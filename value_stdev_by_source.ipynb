Furthermore, due to the deconstruction required to lower the communication device from the current towers and the increased security restrictions which has resulted in delays in the support team accessing the site, accessing the communication equipment atop the tower has resulted in ground services personnel working at unsafe heights. \\nThe current towers in-situ were re-purposed communication towers and were not manufactured fit for this current purpose.\\nFor operational purposes the tower solution must be mobile on varying terrain for optimum positioning, have a deployed height of  up to 17m. Additionally, the tower must lift a payload of 350kg. In order to allow prompt access to the communication equipment atop the towers, particularly during periods of conflict, as well as to enable interoperability with other international governments under FMS and during periods of hostile winds, the towers must be able to be raised and lowered through either a mechanical or electrical system by the end user.

Furthermore, due to the deconstruction required to lower the communication device from the current towers and the increased security restrictions which has resulted in delays in the support team accessing the site, accessing the communication equipment atop the tower has resulted in ground services personnel working at unsafe heights. \\\\nThe current towers in-situ were re-purposed communication towers and were not manufactured fit for this current purpose.\\\\nFor operational purposes the tower solution must be mobile on varying terrain for optimum positioning, have a deployed height of  up to 17m. Additionally, the tower must lift a payload of 350kg. In order to allow prompt access to the communication equipment atop the towers, particularly during periods of conflict, as well as to enable interoperability with other international governments under FMS and during periods of hostile winds, the towers must be able to be raised and lowered through either a mechanical or electrical system by the end user. The towers must have interfacing plates that are compatible with the communication equipment.\\\\nFollowing  market research,  the PTM 100 towers  are the only towers that are  capable of meeting the mobility, technical and interoperability requirements. In addition, the PTM 100 tower variant is the only tower that can house the specific GDT and  Tower Solutions US are the only economic provider of these towers. For these technical reasons, the contract will be negotiated with Tower Solutions US who are the designer and manufacturer of the PTM 100 towers, without prior publication of a contract notice under Regulation 16(1) (a)(ii) of the DSPCR.\\\", \\\"tenderPeriod\\\": {\\\"startDate\\\": \\\"2020-03-19T00:00:00+00:00\\\"}, \\\"procuringEntity\\\": {\\\"name\\\": \\\"Ministry of Defence\\\"}}, \\\"language\\\": \\\"en\\\", \\\"initiationType\\\": \\\"tender\\\"}], \\\"publisher\\\": {\\\"uid\\\": \\\"https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/04962733\\\", \\\"uri\\\": \\\"https://openopps.com\\\", \\\"name\\\": \\\"Open Opps\\\", \\\"scheme\\\": \\\"Companies House\\\"}, \\\"publishedDate\\\": \\\"2020-05-10T01:30:53.643830+00:00\\\", \\\"publicationPolicy\\\": \\\"https://openopps.com/legal/\\\"}\", \"pubdate\": \"2020-03-19 00:00:00+00\"}, {\"id\": 181932373, \"source\": \"td_etenders_ni\", \"source_id\": \"2833186\", \"ocid\": \"ocds-0c46vo-0015-2833186\", \"release_tag\": \"[\\\"tender\\\"]\", \"language\": \"en\", \"title\": \"WE2833186B Cath-Lab 01 Ventilation Installation, Altnagelvin Hospital Site\", \"description\": \"Western Health and Social Care Trust are seeking to appoint a contractor to undertake the provision, supply and commissioning of a Air Handling Unit to serve the existing Cath-Lab 01 to Theatre standards.

(\\u201cCAE\\u201d) for the provision of Magnetic Anomaly Detection-XR Sensors (\\u201cMAD-XR Sensors\\u201d) and ancillaries, including training and support.

The Framework Agreement will be consisting of Part A (the Framework Agreement) and separate Part Bs, which describes the deliverables specific to each Delivery Team\\u2019s requirement across the different OCs \\u2013 this will describe the SOR and contain the Price and Period of contract.  From the outset there will be 4 (four) Part Bs covering the requirement for the Air Commodities, MSS, C17 and APS DTs.  The MoD wishes to provide for the ongoing maintenance of its current life preserving equipment and, in respect of an item considered to be beyond economical repair, to purchase a replacement item.\\nIt is considered that this contract can be awarded using the negotiated procedure without prior publication of a contract notice pursuant to Article 28(1)(e) of Directive 2009/81/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (Regulation 16(1)(a)(ii) of the UK Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations 2011 for technical reasons). The requirement to carry out manufacture of equipment/spares and to undertake repairs in support of the capability requires specialist design knowledge of the equipment and component items, the production and repair process, along with specific special-to-type tools and test equipment. This technical expertise means that it is impossible for any company other than the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) to carry out the activities required in the time-frame specified.\\nEquipment required to be carried within aircraft platforms needs to be independently qualified for airworthiness, and undergo rigorous testing and trials per aircraft type to achieve the required certification and enable usage on that platform.

The Framework Agreement will be consisting of Part A (the Framework Agreement) and separate Part Bs, which describes the deliverables specific to each Delivery Team\\u2019s requirement across the different OCs \\u2013 this will describe the SOR and contain the Price and Period of contract.  From the outset there will be 4 (four) Part Bs covering the requirement for the Air Commodities, MSS, C17 and APS DTs.  The MoD wishes to provide for the ongoing maintenance of its current life preserving equipment and, in respect of an item considered to be beyond economical repair, to purchase a replacement item.\\\\nIt is considered that this contract can be awarded using the negotiated procedure without prior publication of a contract notice pursuant to Article 28(1)(e) of Directive 2009/81/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (Regulation 16(1)(a)(ii) of the UK Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations 2011 for technical reasons). The requirement to carry out manufacture of equipment/spares and to undertake repairs in support of the capability requires specialist design knowledge of the equipment and component items, the production and repair process, along with specific special-to-type tools and test equipment. This technical expertise means that it is impossible for any company other than the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) to carry out the activities required in the time-frame specified.\\\\nEquipment required to be carried within aircraft platforms needs to be independently qualified for airworthiness, and undergo rigorous testing and trials per aircraft type to achieve the required certification and enable usage on that platform. This critical safety requirement prevents component parts being sourced from alternative manufacturers. Survitec Group Ltd has the necessary and specific know-how to be able to produce, maintain and repair the items required in accordance with the Airworthiness requirements. Any replacement products would have to undergo a series of tests and trials for platform integration, airworthiness assessments and specific equipment manufacturer trials, required to demonstrate that a product is fit-for-purpose for the military aviation environment.

Bidders should refrain from using any other forms of direct communication other than the Bravo eTendering message / correspondence feature during this procurement exercise as it reduces the effectiveness of the audit trail.For the avoidance of doubt, WMCA (on behalf of MML) will not accept any telephone clarifications from any Bidder in any circumstance whatsoever.\\u00a0Procurement Portalhttps://wmca.bravosolution.co.uk\\\", \\\"tenderPeriod\\\": {\\\"endDate\\\": \\\"2020-04-20T00:00:00+00:00\\\"}}, \\\"langauge\\\": \\\"en\\\", \\\"language\\\": \\\"en\\\", \\\"initiationType\\\": \\\"tender\\\"}], \\\"publisher\\\": {\\\"uid\\\": \\\"https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/04962733\\\", \\\"uri\\\": \\\"https://openopps.com\\\", \\\"name\\\": \\\"Open Opps\\\", \\\"scheme\\\": \\\"Companies House\\\"}, \\\"publishedDate\\\": \\\"2020-03-24T01:33:16.719800+00:00\\\", \\\"publicationPolicy\\\": \\\"https://openopps.com/legal/\\\"}\", \"pubdate\": \"2020-03-23 22:06:11.277437+00\"}, {\"id\": 184700164, \"source\": \"td_finditinbirmingham_uk\", \"source_id\": \"WKa7/o5GpAfyDo0vpJthmA\", \"ocid\": \"ocds-0c46vo-0054-WKa7-o5GpAfyDo0vpJthmA\", \"release_tag\": \"[\\\"tender\\\"]\", \"language\": \"en\", \"title\": \"Engineering Inspections\", \"description\": \"The requirement is for the provision of inspections of lifting and other equipment as covered under Lift Operations and Lifting Equipment Regulations 1998 (LOLER) and Pressure Systems Safety Regulations 2000 (PSSR).Typical items relating to LOLER inspections include:\\u2022 Passenger/Goods Lifts\\u2022 Stair lifts\\u2022 Ceiling track and personal lifting hoists and slings\\u2022 Disabled bath equipment\\u2022 Hoists/Hoist accessories/mobile hoists.

The consultant is required during the Development Phase to provide: \\u25aa\\tAudience development and research done in conjunction with an Activity Planner; \\u25aa\\tAn NLHF compliant Interpretation Plan \\u25aa\\tExhibition Design proposals to RIBA 3 and following a break clause for assessment of a second round NLHF bid, in the Delivery phase to \\u25aa\\tExhibition Design proposals to RIBA 4 \\u25aa\\tInstall and fit out Interpretation and displays (RIBA 7) The practice is also required to mentor and be shadowed by an FfWHR Interpretation Trainee during the Delivery Phase. It is envisaged that FfWHR will require external assistance to deliver training to volunteer tour guides at the early stages of Delivery and \\u2018train the trainer\\u2019 for key staff and volunteers to develop organisational capacity and resilience. This external assistance does not form part of the scope of work for this brief, but FfWHR would be interested to hear in outline terms what the consultant could offer in this regard. Part of the briefs for both Activity and Interpretation Planners includes Audience Development in the Development Phase where the two consultants should work independently, jointly and cooperatively with each other to produce a cohesive piece of work ensuring that Interpretation and Activities for intended audiences are rooted in consultation with potential audiences and some trialling and testing of both Activity and Interpretation. Expertise in specialisms such as working with learning programmes or hard to reach audiences is desirable. It is worth emphasising that this project presents opportunities for dynamic interpretation across sites.  It is not a traditional, static interpretation approach.  The opportunity lies in supporting moving and living heritage.  Digital Interpretation will be a key component. Scope of work: The Interpretation Plan (Development Stage) The consultant will be required to develop an interpretation plan and exhibition design suitable to support a Round Two NLHF application. Consideration should be given to the NLHF document - Interpretation Good Practice Guidance. The plan should establish the aims and objectives of interpretation, principles of interpretation, themes and storylines as well as design drawings and illustrations.

The consultant is required during the Development Phase to provide: \\u25aa\\\\tAudience development and research done in conjunction with an Activity Planner; \\u25aa\\\\tAn NLHF compliant Interpretation Plan \\u25aa\\\\tExhibition Design proposals to RIBA 3 and following a break clause for assessment of a second round NLHF bid, in the Delivery phase to \\u25aa\\\\tExhibition Design proposals to RIBA 4 \\u25aa\\\\tInstall and fit out Interpretation and displays (RIBA 7) The practice is also required to mentor and be shadowed by an FfWHR Interpretation Trainee during the Delivery Phase. It is envisaged that FfWHR will require external assistance to deliver training to volunteer tour guides at the early stages of Delivery and \\u2018train the trainer\\u2019 for key staff and volunteers to develop organisational capacity and resilience. This external assistance does not form part of the scope of work for this brief, but FfWHR would be interested to hear in outline terms what the consultant could offer in this regard. Part of the briefs for both Activity and Interpretation Planners includes Audience Development in the Development Phase where the two consultants should work independently, jointly and cooperatively with each other to produce a cohesive piece of work ensuring that Interpretation and Activities for intended audiences are rooted in consultation with potential audiences and some trialling and testing of both Activity and Interpretation. Expertise in specialisms such as working with learning programmes or hard to reach audiences is desirable. It is worth emphasising that this project presents opportunities for dynamic interpretation across sites.  It is not a traditional, static interpretation approach.  The opportunity lies in supporting moving and living heritage.  Digital Interpretation will be a key component. Scope of work: The Interpretation Plan (Development Stage) The consultant will be required to develop an interpretation plan and exhibition design suitable to support a Round Two NLHF application. Consideration should be given to the NLHF document - Interpretation Good Practice Guidance. The plan should establish the aims and objectives of interpretation, principles of interpretation, themes and storylines as well as design drawings and illustrations. It should provide the Client with recommendations on content and budgets. The plan needs to contain detailed design drawings to RIBA Work Stage 3 and detailed costings. The plan needs to be developed in consultation with Client staff, with the Activity Planner and other stakeholders including potential and current audiences. The consultant will be required for the NLHF round 2 submission to: \\u25aa\\\\tUnderstand the history and context of the project \\u25aa\\\\tAgree with the Client the aims and objectives of the interpretation scheme \\u25aa\\\\tWork with the Client and other consultants to agree the target audiences \\u25aa\\\\tLead the creative input into the interpretation scheme and final designs for the exhibitions \\u25aa\\\\tLead the creative input into a design that is sympathetic to the historic site and its features \\u25aa\\\\tWork with the architects to develop a new approach to orientation and visitor flow \\u25aa\\\\tAgree with the Client on the range and necessity of consultation with other specialists and groups who should input into the process \\u25aa\\\\tUndertake research and work with Client staff to detail the themes and storylines \\u25aa\\\\tIdentify key objects and other resources for the delivery of the interpretation \\u25aa\\\\tDevelop proposals for the interpretation scheme to deliver aims and objectives, including recommendations on style, content, media and storylines \\u25aa\\\\tConsider carefully the opportunities for interpretation via an electronic platform working in close cooperation with the Client\\u2019s marketing work which covers pre-visit, commun\\\", \\\"tenderPeriod\\\": {\\\"endDate\\\": \\\"2020-04-03T12:00:00+00:00\\\", \\\"startDate\\\": \\\"2020-03-16T00:00:00+00:00\\\"}, \\\"awardCriteriaDetails\\\": \\\"General Project requirement for attendance on site, reports and meetings\\\", \\\"submissionMethodDetails\\\": \\\"sell2wales.gov.uk\\\", \\\"procurementMethodDetails\\\": \\\"Single stage - Any candidate may submit a tender.\\\"}, \\\"language\\\": \\\"en\\\", \\\"releases\\\": {\\\"procurementMethod\\\": \\\"open\\\"}, \\\"initiationType\\\": \\\"tender\\\"}], \\\"publisher\\\": {\\\"uid\\\": \\\"https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/04962733\\\", \\\"uri\\\": \\\"https://openopps.com\\\", \\\"name\\\": \\\"Open Opps\\\", \\\"scheme\\\": \\\"Companies House\\\"}, \\\"publishedDate\\\": \\\"2020-03-17T01:34:20.233408+00:00\\\", \\\"publicationPolicy\\\": \\\"https://openopps.com/legal/\\\"}\", \"pubdate\": \"2020-03-16 00:00:00+00\"}, {\"id\": 183097409, \"source\": \"td_millstream\", \"source_id\": \"MAR329089\", \"ocid\": \"ocds-0c46vo-0022-MAR329089\", \"release_tag\": \"[\\\"tender\\\"]\", \"language\": \"en\", \"title\": \"Ffestiniog and Welsh Highland Rlwys - Evaluation Consultant, Boston Lodge Works Restoration Project\", \"description\": \"Brief: Evaluation Consultant We require an Evaluation Consultant to produce an NLHF compliant evaluation of the project which follows NLHF Guidance.

The plan is being commissioned as part of proposals to develop BLW. It will be a key document in support of a Round Two application to the NLHF to carry out the project.

Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) Electro-Optical Cameras. \\nISTAR Procurement Development Group is seeking expressions of interest from suppliers of Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) electro-optical cameras. The suite of cameras covering visible, thermal and SWIR are required to address both short and long-range capabilities. The cameras sought are to replace an ageing fleet of discrete surveillance cameras with \\u2018best of breed\\u2019 COTS solutions and shall be purchased at intervals (to be defined) through a Framework Agreement.\\nThe suite of cameras must be sufficiently robust to enable 24hr coverage for the purposes of identifying Subjects of Interest at range in both urban and rural environments. The requirement for the COTS solutions offered shall be to employ the latest technologies to meet the demanding range of performance requirements needed. \\nThe cameras must be able to transmit full motion video (FMV) over existing in-service bearers, and camera outputs must be capable of being viewed and stored on Open Standards platforms. It should be noted that, as a suite of cameras, potentially from multiple suppliers, all are required to be compatible with existing in-service bearers, and to reduce the logistics burden, a common (to the suite) camera connector is also being sought.\\nAll cameras shall be subject to size, weight and power constraints which shall be defined in later correspondence. Efficient use of battery power shall be a strong consideration with the aim of reducing the deployed logistics burden. All products offered must demonstrate high availability and reliability figures for deployment in harsh environments as a means of minimising operational disruption.\\nThe cameras must have an in-service life of at least 5 years, maintenance and support activity shall be covered in the Tasking Orders issued as part of the overall Framework.  \\nFollowing receipt of Expressions of Interest, interested parties shall be required to complete a detailed pre-qualification questionnaire. Responses shall be marked and graded with the intention of including a maximum of ten companies on the initial list. Opportunities shall arise at later intervals (to be specified) for new entrants to the market to apply for inclusion or for those not selected this time to revisit participation later. \\nThose down-selected for inclusion on the Framework shall receive invitations to bid for the initial requirement. This shall be based on the principles of a normal tender, but to shorter timescales. The Authority might wish, as part of assessment, to conduct trials in order to verify performance criterion specified by suppliers. \\nIt is intended to hold an Industry Day after the PQQ stage during which all aspects of the programme shall be discussed. Please note that only companies holding, or willing to attain appropriate security clearances shall be allowed to participate in the programme. \\nInterested parties are invited to register interest using the Multiuser account (DES ISTAR-EO-FW) provided not later than 08 June 2020. This account must also be used for all other project related communications. Details of products available would also be of interest as an early indication of products currently on the market.\\nIMPORTANT:\\n\\n Whilst there is every intention of progressing this requirement through to service, it remains subject to Approvals and funding.\\n2. \\nMain Place of Performance or Delivery:\\n South-West\\n3. \\nCan a supplier bid alone for only a part of the contract?: Yes    \\n\\n1. \\nReverse Auction:\\n No. A Reverse Auction, conducted using electronic means, will not be used as part of the procurement process for this requirement. \\n\\n1. \\nEstimated Value of Requirement:\\n Category E1: 4.5M - 10M GBP\\n\\n1. \\nQA Standards:\\n BS EN ISO 9001 with appropriate scope \\n\\n1. \\nAdditional Information:\\n \\nThe contracting authority considers that this contract may be suitable for economic operators that are small or medium enterprises (SMEs). However, any selection of tenderers will be based solely on the criteria set out for the procurement.Suppliers interested in working with the MOD should register on its Supplier Information Database (SID), available at www.contracts.mod.uk.

The CAA is the regulator of all aspects of civil aviation and the training will be delivered by Civil Aviation Authority International Group(CAAi) , part of the CAA. The contract value is not expected to exceed \\u00a3280,000. \\\\nIt is considered that this contract can be placed with the CAA using the negotiated procedure without prior publication of a contract notice pursuant to Article 32(2)(b) of Directive 2014/24/EU (Regulation 32(2)(b)(ii) of the Public Contracts Regulations 2015) as only CAAi can deliver the services required by the UK Ministry of Defence for the following reasons:\\\\n\\\\n The CAA is the UK civil regulator for civilian aircraft certification and the MAA fulfils the same function for military aircraft. As such the MAA is required to liaise directly with the CAA regarding best practice and justification of process in order to fulfil its purpose as recommended by the Haddon-Cave Report and to develop its policy and best practice against its civilian equivalent. The CAA is the only provider of training with the knowledge and skills and subject matter expertise to provide suitable training to educate MAA personnel to fulfil this requirement and who can ensure as part of that training the use of up to date information, regulations and regulatory know-how including from other regulatory bodies from other countries.\\u201d\\\", \\\"tenderPeriod\\\": {\\\"startDate\\\": \\\"2020-03-23T00:00:00+00:00\\\"}, \\\"procuringEntity\\\": {\\\"name\\\": \\\"Ministry of Defence\\\"}}, \\\"language\\\": \\\"en\\\", \\\"initiationType\\\": \\\"tender\\\"}], \\\"publisher\\\": {\\\"uid\\\": \\\"https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/04962733\\\", \\\"uri\\\": \\\"https://openopps.com\\\", \\\"name\\\": \\\"Open Opps\\\", \\\"scheme\\\": \\\"Companies House\\\"}, \\\"publishedDate\\\": \\\"2020-05-10T01:30:51.514196+00:00\\\", \\\"publicationPolicy\\\": \\\"https://openopps.com/legal/\\\"}\", \"pubdate\": \"2020-03-23 00:00:00+00\"}, {\"id\": 183781024, \"source\": \"td_mod_uk\", \"source_id\": \"2249682063\", \"ocid\": \"ocds-0c46vo-0120-2249682063\", \"release_tag\": \"[\\\"tender\\\"]\", \"language\": \"en\", \"title\": \"UK-Bristol: Decontamination equipment.\\n\\t           \\n\\t\\t\\t       \\t\\n\\t\\t\\t       \\t\\t(Defence)\", \"description\": \"Type of document:\\n \\nContract Notice\\nCountry\\n:\\n\\n United Kingdom\\nUK-Bristol:\\n\\n Decontamination equipment.\\n\\n\\tTitle:\\n\\n UK-Bristol: Decontamination equipment.\\n\\t\\nI.1)Name, Addresses And Contact Point(s)\\n\\t\\t Ministry of Defence, ISTAR, Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Delivery Team (CBRN DT)\\n\\t\\t Abbeywood South, Bristol, BS34 8JH, United Kingdom\\n\\t\\t Tel. +44 03067983372, Email: \\nlousha.heaven102@mod.gov.uk\\n\\t\\t Contact:\\n\\n Lousha Heaven\\n\\t\\t Main Address:\\n\\n www.contracts.mod.uk\\n\\t\\nI.2)Type Of Purchasing Body\\n\\t\\tNot Provided\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\nII.1)Description\\n\\t\\t\\nII.1.1)Title attributed to the contract by the contracting authority/entity:\\n Manufacture, Supply and Support of Decontamination Kit Personal (1, 2, Special and Technical) and Chemical Agent Decontaminant (CAD)\\n\\t\\t\\nII.1.2)Short description of the contract or purchase:\\n \\n\\t\\tDecontamination equipment.

The UK Ministry of Defence (MOD) is to replace the vehicle-based Land Environment Air Picture Provision (LEAPP) capability due to a change of operational use and current obsolescence issues.  The LEAPP system provides air situational awareness to LAND HQs, creating a Local Air Picture (LAP) from G-AMB radars combined with the Recognised Air Picture (RAP) via Tactical Data Links (TDL).  The MoD\\u2019s requirement for LEAPP to have a small form factor, which is essential to allow its continued deployment into LAND HQ\\u2019s.  \\nThe new small factor system must integrate Giraffe-AMB radars using an ASTERIX standard, a Link 16 Multifunctional Information Distribution System-Joint Tactical Radio System (MIDS-JTRS) tactical data link terminal and external systems using a Joint Range Extension Applications Protocol-C (JREAP-C) interface. The means to connect the Command and Control (C2) to multiple G-AMB\\u2019s via both wireless and wired links is required.  The LEAPP requirement is for the provision of 5 sets, each comprising C2, Human Machine Interface (HMI), TDL and communication equipment.  Each set should be provided in ruggedised cases allowing the system to be man-portable in its component form.  \\nThe required Initial Operating Capability (IOC) timeline of January 2022 needs COTS/MOTS candidate systems to already be at production standard, TRL7 or higher.

The workshop is part of a thematic event hosted by Birmingham, one of 5 transnational partners in the project (Genoa IT, Gavle SE, Tartu EE, Nyiregyhaza HU). The event was not initially intended to be delivered by on-line format, but as a physical event to the city of Birmingham. The pan-European Covid-19 lockdown has meant we have had to move the event on-line to help keep the project within the planned timescales.\\\", \\\"tenderPeriod\\\": {\\\"endDate\\\": \\\"2020-04-29T00:00:00+00:00\\\"}}, \\\"langauge\\\": \\\"en\\\", \\\"language\\\": \\\"en\\\", \\\"initiationType\\\": \\\"tender\\\"}], \\\"publisher\\\": {\\\"uid\\\": \\\"https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/04962733\\\", \\\"uri\\\": \\\"https://openopps.com\\\", \\\"name\\\": \\\"Open Opps\\\", \\\"scheme\\\": \\\"Companies House\\\"}, \\\"publishedDate\\\": \\\"2020-04-16T01:33:51.603746+00:00\\\", \\\"publicationPolicy\\\": \\\"https://openopps.com/legal/\\\"}\", \"pubdate\": \"2020-04-15 22:11:32.499424+00\"}, {\"id\": 189885141, \"source\": \"td_finditinbirmingham_uk\", \"source_id\": \"DMzZkYGl7ZelStiWeWgJgQ\", \"ocid\": \"ocds-0c46vo-0054-DMzZkYGl7ZelStiWeWgJgQ\", \"release_tag\": \"[\\\"tender\\\"]\", \"language\": \"en\", \"title\": \"Northleigh C of E Primary School \\u2013 Installation of External Automatic Access Security Gates\", \"description\": \"Place Partnership Ltd. on behalf of Worcestershire Children\\u2019s First invite suitable, qualified and experienced Electrical Automatic Gate Installers / Contractors to carry out the installation of external automatic gates at Northleigh C of E Primary School St. Peter's Rd, Malvern Worcestershire WR14 1QSScope of Works \\u2013 Installation of Electrical Automatic Access Security GatesSite Visits: It is recommended that contractors ascertain the nature of the site, access thereto and all local conditions and restrictions likely to affect the execution of the Works.It is appreciated that due to the current restrictions of COVID-19 site access will be limited.Arrangements / Appointments for a site visit: Contact the Place Partnership Project Manager, Thomas Pingriff Mobile. 07734 777328 -

The LIDSS equipment has already been designed, manufactured & delivered under contract. Therefore, there is now a requirement for a follow-on support contract to be placed.

A substantial amount of Asbestos Containing Materials (ACMs) have been identified within the buildings which will be required to be safely extracted and disposed of. The works are to include costs for the following: 1. The complete demolition to a depth of 1.0m below new agreed ground level of all permanent structures. 2. The positions of stock piles on the site to be planned and to be agreed with the Project Manager (PM) before demolition commences. Stock piles shall not be positioned over services or access roads. 3.

The UK MoD intends to place this contract with Lockheed Martin Aeronautics (LMA).
