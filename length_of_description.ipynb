Through this improvement and the school leader\\u2019s active involvement in the quality of teaching, we aim to improve learning and ultimately student outcomes.\", \"description_length\": 3499.0}, {\"ocid\": \"ocds-0c46vo-0020-twi_266\", \"source\": \"td_in-tend\", \"buyer\": \"The Welding Institute\", \"description\": \"TWI is one of the world\\u2019s foremost independent research and technology organisations, with expertise in solving problems in all aspects of manufacturing, fabrication and whole-life integrity management technologies. Established in Cambridge, UK in 1946 and with facilities across the globe, the company has a first class reputation for service through its teams of internationally respected consultants, scientists, engineers and support staff, whose knowledge and expertise is available to its members. \\n Shakespeare Engineering International Limited is an independent, privately owned manufacturing and design company specialising in CNC machining, pressing and assembly of electro-mechanical components for industry world-wide. Shakespeare\\u2019s success is attributed to an innovative approach to the manufacture of components and the care and customer focus employed. \\n This specification has been produced as part of an initiative known as PIP-II (LBNF/DUNE PIP-II Cryomodules), which is part-funded by the Science & Technology Facilities Council (STFC) using Research Council UK Grants (RCUK). TWI is the grant recipient and Shakespeare Engineering is a contractor/collaborator in the programme. \\n PIP-II is the first US accelerator project that will have significant contributions from international partners. Part of the contribution made by the UK will require a capability to produce niobium cavities to be established, and for this to be demonstrated by the production of a single cavity at the conclusion of the present project. The cavities consist of a series of niobium half-shells and niobium/niobium-titanium end pieces which are formed, machined and electron beam welded. \\n The DUNE-PIP-II cavity parts and tooling which will be machined with this CNC lathe form part of the UK government commitment to support the development of the Fermilab (USA) PIP-II particle accelerator design with an energy goal of 800MeV, while also establishing a vital link in the UK supply chain for manufacture of this type of component. Such cavities have previously been prepared in the US. This establishes a baseline for the process and equipment specification, and establishes the feasibility of procuring a suitable machine (as well as identifying a potential supplier). \\n The machine required for the UK programme will be procured by TWI but delivered to and installed at Shakespeare Engineering International Limited, 41-49 Bancrofts Road, South Woodham Ferrers, Chelmsford, Essex, CM3 5UQ, United Kingdom. All rights to use the equipment and responsibility to maintain the equipment will be passed directly to Shakespeare Engineering International Limited on acceptance at their site. The supplier warranty and service provision will be assigned directly to Shakespeare Engineering International Limited by the supplier.\\n The machine has been specified for the machining of DUNE PIP-II niobium RF cavities; these require specialist machining knowhow and avoidance of contamination to assure the assemblies meet the stringent material property requirements when in service.  The CNC lathe will have a 40 horsepower spindle, with 2 speed gearbox and spindle speed range of zero to 2400rpm.\\n The cavity assembly outline dimensions are shown in Figures 1 and 2 of the Specification and Compliance document. The assembly will be up to 1500mm long, 500mm diameter and weigh up to 100kg and is constructed of approximately 30 components. \\n Please ensure all correspondence relating to this tender is submitted through the In-Tend correspondence facilities by 6th March 2020 @ 12 noon.\", \"description_length\": 3580.0}, {\"ocid\": \"ocds-0c46vo-0020-iomg_1214\", \"source\": \"td_in-tend\", \"buyer\": \"Isle of Man Government\", \"description\": \"External Refurbishment of Play Areas at Cronk Grianagh & Fairy Hill\\n   The Isle of Man Government invites expressions of interest from suitably qualified and experienced MACCS registered contractors interested in being included on a select list of tenderers to provide the above works to the Department of Infrastructure.\\n For Further Information click `View Synopsis`.\\n Suppliers that would like to take part in this tender process are invited to \\\"Express Interest\\\".\\n ****PLEASE NOTE - Once you have clicked on `Express Interest` a `Form of Acknowledgement` tab will appear.

Established in Cambridge, UK in 1946 and with facilities across the globe, the company has a first class reputation for service through its teams of internationally respected consultants, scientists, engineers and support staff, whose knowledge and expertise is available to its members. \\n Shakespeare Engineering International Limited is an independent, privately owned manufacturing and design company specialising in CNC machining, pressing and assembly of electro-mechanical components for industry world-wide. Shakespeare\\u2019s success is attributed to an innovative approach to the manufacture of components and the care and customer focus employed. \\n This specification has been produced as part of an initiative known as PIP-II (LBNF/DUNE PIP-II Cryomodules), which is part-funded by the Science & Technology Facilities Council (STFC) using Research Council UK Grants (RCUK). TWI is the grant recipient and Shakespeare Engineering is a contractor/collaborator in the programme. \\n PIP-II is the first US accelerator project that will have significant contributions from international partners. Part of the contribution made by the UK will require a capability to produce niobium cavities to be established, and for this to be demonstrated by the production of a single cavity at the conclusion of the present project. The cavities consist of a series of niobium half-shells and niobium/niobium-titanium end pieces which are formed, machined and electron beam welded. \\n The DUNE-PIP-II cavity parts which will be machined with this hydraulic press form part of the UK government commitment to support the development of the Fermilab (USA) PIP-II particle accelerator design with an energy goal of 800MeV, while also establishing a vital link in the UK supply chain for manufacture of this type of component. Such cavities have previously been prepared in the US. This establishes a baseline for the process and equipment specification, and establishes the feasibility of procuring a suitable machine (as well as identifying a potential supplier). \\n The machine required for the UK programme will be procured by TWI but delivered to and installed at Shakespeare Engineering International Limited, 41-49 Bancrofts Road, South Woodham Ferrers, Chelmsford, Essex, CM3 5UQ, United Kingdom. All rights to use the equipment and responsibility to maintain the equipment will be passed directly to Shakespeare Engineering International Limited on acceptance at their site. The supplier warranty and service provision will be assigned directly to Shakespeare Engineering International Limited by the supplier. \\n The machine has been specified for the pressing of DUNE PIP-II niobium RF cavities; these require specialist pressing knowhow and avoidance of contamination to assure the assemblies meet the stringent material property requirements when in service.  The C-frame hydraulic press will have a 100 tonne minimum force on the top ram, and minimum 50 tonne force on the under pressure cushion. Shakespeare Engineering have previously manufactured similar cavity components using similar machinery and now seek a larger capacity C-frame press allowing direct transfer of parameters and operating practice for this programme. \\n The cavity assembly outline dimensions are shown in Figures 1 and 2 of the Specification and Compliance document. The assembly will be up to 1500mm long, 500mm diameter and weigh up to 100kg and is constructed of approximately 30 components. \\n Please ensure all correspondence relating to this tender is submitted through the In-Tend correspondence facilities by 9th March 2020 @ 12 noon.\", \"description_length\": 3828.0}, {\"ocid\": \"ocds-0c46vo-0020-quadrant-construction_276\", \"source\": \"td_in-tend\", \"buyer\": \"Quadrant Construction Services Ltd\", \"description\": \"London and Quadrant Housing Trust and its subsidiary Quadrant Construction Services are one of the largest providers of affordable housing in the UK, housing over 250,000 people in more than 95,000 homes, primarily across London and the South East of England.

Interestingly, extent of deposition of these proteins in the human brain does not correlate well with either the severity or the progression of the corresponding disease; for example, many people with considerable amyloid-beta protein deposition in brain show no signs of memory loss or difficulties with language, which are most common symptoms in Alzheimer\\u2019s disease. Recent scientific evidence suggests that small sticky clusters of these proteins which form early stages at protein accumulation process are the primary disease-causing species. These small protein cluster form early stages of disease and can damage nerve cell consequently impair cognitive ability as well as motor functions. These sticky protein clusters are very diverse and transient in nature, present in very low concentrations human brain tissue. Therefore, their identity in the human brain is not properly identified due to lack highly sensitive methods. This significantly complicates diagnostic of the neurodegenerative disease that detect the presence of these protein clusters in human tissue or biofluid samples such as blood or cerebrospinal fluid or developing disease modifying therapies that target these toxic protein species in human brain.\\n To solve this problem, the University of Sheffield will build a very powerful microscope which will allow us to visualise every single protein clusters form in human brain without altering their structure or function. Based on this microscope, we will develop highly sensitive methods to determine the structure of these small protein species and measure how they induce toxicity in human brain. We will study the biofluids from affected individual using this microscope and determine the specific molecular details such as size, structure, composition of disease-causing species accurately and reproducibly. Not only this will provide fundamental new mechanistic information about the disease-causing small protein species in human brain, it will also indicate if certain types of species can be used as biomarkers to diagnose the presence of certain neurodegenerative disease. Moreover, the specific molecular details of these toxic protein clusters will also pave the way for the development of much need disease modifying drugs which will stop either their formation or block their toxic effects.\\n The University of Sheffield requires a Compound Microscope to form part of the build of a fluorescence microscope for the purpose of imaging proteins or protein aggregates at 'single molecule resolution' in solutions, cells and sectioned tissue (with light sheet imaging in Epi mode) in 3D and which also allows us to perform localisation based super-resolution microscopy (like STORM, DNA-PAINT etc) in 2D in (using total internal reflection mode).  \\n We would like to build this set-up using an inverted motorised microscope body with very high flexibility, equipped with high-numerical aperture objective (to study at high resolution), an auto-focus system (allows long time experiment without any drift) and an automated stage (to image image multiple regions of the samples). \\n To compliment the Compound Microscope multiple lasers (4 different colours) and a highly sensitive camera will be purchased separately and added by the University. \\n In the near future we will add new optical modules in such a way that we can do label free imaging of single proteins.\\n The full technical specification can be found in the tender documentation which will be sent to you once you have expressed your interest. \\n Tender Process and Documentation:\\n This is a non-E.U. open exercise.

As part of the Birmingham and Black Country conurbation.\\nWalsall has a retail catchment of over 3 million people. Its central location provides excellent connectivity by road and rail to Birmingham, London and the rest of the UK. The town centre\\u2019s centrally located railway station and bus interchange generates 15 million passenger trips per year providing Walsall with an infrastructure network that can facilitate significant growth. \\n Like many town centres and high streets across the country, Walsall Town Centre is facing some well publicised common challenges as a result of unprecedented changes in the retail industry as well as changing consumer behaviours and expectations.  In response, to these challenges, the Council produced a Town Centre Masterplan, which provides a 20-year vision and sets-out 10 catalytic interventions, which will enable the physical transformation of the Town Centre.  \\n Furthermore, following the success of a 1st round application to the Government\\u2019s Future High Streets Fund (FHSF) Walsall Council are now working through the 2nd stage application process and preparing a full business case to Government. If successful at this 2nd stage, securing FHSF funding will enable the council to deliver Phase 1 of the Town Centre Masterplan (as set-out below). \\n Footfall data is an invaluable metric which can help direct places to better understand what is happening in their area. This data also provides a useful indicator of a projects success.  If the submission for FHSF is successful there is a Government requirement for the Council to measure and capture footfall data across the defined intervention area prior to project commencement, during implementation and post completion.  The Council is seeking external support to deliver this.\\n Phase 1 Masterplan Delivery - The FHSF Project\\nThe FHSF project focusses on creating a \\u2018coherent transport gateway\\u2019 that better connects the centrally located bus and rail stations, spanning across the centre of Walsall\\u2019s high street (Park Street). The project will radically improve the visitor experience, drive wider regenerative benefits and re-position Walsall's economic status as a sub-regional centre.  The project consists of two parts as described below; \\n Transforming the Walsall Rail Station/ Saddlers Centre - \\nThis element will transform the rail station arrival experience by creating a better connected, more welcoming place for visitors and residents.  It will enhance the rail concourse, provide better access to the rail station platforms and give the rail station a greater presence within the Town Centre.   The FHSF project will also modernise and re-purpose existing retail floorspace within the Saddlers Shopping Centre, for alternative uses including Food & Beverage and leisure uses. \\n Creation of Station Public Square - \\nIt will create a physical and visual link, between the rail station and main bus station creating a \\u2018coherent transport interchange\\u2019 on the high street. The new public space will attract more people and enhance dwell time, thus becoming the catalyst for the transformation of the whole town centre.\\nThe project will need to be delivered by 31 March 2024 and subsequently there will be a need to collect footfall data beyond this period to assess impact of the project post completion.\\t\\t\\n It is anticipated that the contract will start 18 May 2020, though this date is subject to change. \\n The procurement process will be a one-stage open tender process.

With the move, a new National Research facility for Infrastructure Sensing (NRFIS) was established as part of the UK Collaboratorium for Research In Infrastructure and Cities (UKCRIC) and funded through the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC). \\n The new research facility builds on the University\\u2019s track record of delivering innovative sensor advancements through its Centre for Smart Infrastructure and Construction (CSIC), CamBridgeSens research network, and the Centres for Doctoral Training in Sensor Technologies for a Healthy and Sustainable Future (STHSF) and Future Infrastructure and Built Environment: Resilience in a Changing World (FIBE2).\\n NRFIS brings together leading edge engineering facilities and sensor development capabilities under one roof to meet the needs across disciplines of civil engineering, infrastructure design, construction, operation and asset management. It offers an interdisciplinary centre to develop sensors and instrumentation for infrastructure monitoring and assessment, spanning scales from an individual asset, such as a tunnel, building or bridge, to a complex system such as a railway or city district.\\n NRFIS is focused on the research and application of advanced sensor technologies to enable the design, construction, and maintenance of the UK's existing and future infrastructure, such that it is resilient, adaptable, and sustainable for the future. As part of its ambition to establish itself as a STAR research facility, NRFIS is investing in new equipment including a high vacuum packing station. \\n Scope of requirement:\\n NRFIS now requires a high vacuum packing station for thermal as well as electrical getter processes by means of a Getter system with IR vacuum reflow oven. Common applications are sealing of packages with various MEMS sensors under high vacuum by applying thermal and/or electrical Getter activation. \\nIR lamp arrays should allow for independent monitoring and controlled of separate heating zones resulting in excellent heating uniformity under vacuum when reaching a maximum temperature of 450\\u00b0C during the thermal getter process. When the Electrical getter process is applied a power of min 20W should be achieved per package.\", \"description_length\": 2413.0}, {\"ocid\": \"ocds-0c46vo-0020-supplyhertfordshire_4776\", \"source\": \"td_in-tend\", \"buyer\": \"Dacorum Borough Council\", \"description\": \"Dacorum Borough Council is seeking to appoint a suitably qualified Clerk of Works to act on the behalf of the Council (The Client) for the following sites:\\nProject 1:\\tConiston Road, Kings Langley \\u2013 10 Houses; (planning reference: 19/02735/MFA) \\nProject 2:\\tEastwick Row, Hemel Hempstead \\u2013 17 x 1 bed flats, 17 x 2 bed flats and 2 x 3 bed houses\\n(planning reference 4/01719/19/MFA\", \"description_length\": 378.0}, {\"ocid\": \"ocds-0c46vo-0020-sesharedservices_30885\", \"source\": \"td_in-tend\", \"buyer\": \"West Sussex County Council (CAP)\", \"description\": \"The Council are to appoint a contract for Bespoke Fencing and Metal Work as part of the Specialist Highways suite of contracts.\", \"description_length\": 127.0}, {\"ocid\": \"ocds-0c46vo-0020-sesharedservices_30890\", \"source\": \"td_in-tend\", \"buyer\": \"Guildford Borough Council\", \"description\": \"Provision of Planning and Design Consultancy Services for Shawfield Day Centre\", \"description_length\": 78.0}, {\"ocid\": \"ocds-0c46vo-0020-sandwellmbc_3069\", \"source\": \"td_in-tend\", \"buyer\": \"Sandwell Metropolitan Borough Council\", \"description\": \"Corporate Access Project \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201c\\nHighfields Register Office\\nSmall Works Invitation to Quote\", \"description_length\": 87.0}, {\"ocid\": \"ocds-0c46vo-0020-iomg_1285\", \"source\": \"td_in-tend\", \"buyer\": \"Isle of Man Government\", \"description\": \"Good afternoon\\n Please find attached documentation for a quick quote competition to provide a new concrete deck to Garey Bridge, Ramsey to Department of Infrastructure to be carried out between July and August 2020.\\nThe attached documentation consists of:\\n-\\tEnc 1 NEC4 Short Contract \\n-\\tEnc 2 Quick Quote Evaluation Criteria\\n-\\tEnc 3 BoQ\\n-\\tEnc 4 Drawing 100 Location Plan\\n-\\tEnc 5 Drawing 101 Plan View\\n-\\tEnc 6 Drawing 102 Sections and Elevations\\n-\\tEnc 7 Pre-tender Health and Safety Plan\\n-\\tEnc 8 Designers Risk Assessment\\n-\\tEnc 9 General Specification for Maintenance of Highway Structures \\n-\\tEnc 10 Certificate of Non Collusion\\n-\\tEnc 11 Financial Regulations Declaration \\n-\\tEnc 12 Schedule of Confidential Information \\n-\\tEnc 13 Project Charter  \\n The Quick Quote will remain available on the Portal for Expressions of Interest until  noon (12.00 hrs) on15th May 2020and the deadline for submissions is noon (12.00 hrs) on 29th May 2020 and your response must be submitted through the portal by this deadline.  \\n Once you have selected `Express Interest` a `Quote Documents` tab will appear and this is where you will find the above mentioned documents.\\n After the above deadline the Portal will `Lock-Out` and no further submissions can be made.\\n If your organisation does not wish to submit a response to provide these services, please select `Opt-Out` and select a reason.
