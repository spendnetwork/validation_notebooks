Across North Kirklees CCG, it is known that 1.3% of the population is currently accessing NHS ear wax removal services via ear irrigation. This cohort from a population (around 194,000) may benefit from micro suction. It is anticipated that with the implementation of the agreed clinical pathway and the NICE guidance as well as implementation of a locally delivered service the demand on secondary care services will reduce.

The service aims to meet the needs of people with hearing impairment associated with ear wax.

The overarching aims of the service are:

• To provide micro suction in primary care (GP practices) and the community.
• To provide general ear care advice and education and promote self- management prior to medical intervention.
• To improve the pathway of care for people with hearing loss by removing ear wax prior to any referral for audiology assessment.
• To provide equitable timely access to micro suction in primary care and community settings and reduce unnecessary referrals to secondary care.
• To ensure that micro-suction is appropriate, necessary, clinically correct, of high quality, with timely access
• To ensure equity of access across the CCG population.

NHS North Kirklees CCG intends to award a contract to the three highest scoring providers for this service.

The tariff for this service will be £35 for one ear, £60 for two ears.

SITE
The site is located in Gosfield Road, Dagenham, Essex. It consists of a number of buildings. This project is applicable to the main school building only. The building is of three storey construction. Heating is supplied from a central plant which has been installed in the last 2 years.

OUTLINE SCOPE OF WORKS
The existing heating distribution pipework in the floor ducts located mainly under the corridor has reached the end of life and in some areas has failed and been locally repaired. The project works as described in the specification is to install all distribution pipework within the corridor and circulation space areas. The existing heating pipework in the floor ducts will be made redundant and remain in its current location. The new heating distribution pipework will connect to the boiler house primary pipework and rise to high level in the corridor in the close vicinity of the main plant room.
The new pipework installation shall be fully tested, commissioned and flushed prior to handover.

The anticipated tender period will be during May 2020. The ideal construction period (on site) would be during the school summer holiday period from late July to the end of August 2020, but due to the Coronavirus pandemic this may be subject to change. The work will proceed when the risk factors are considered to have reduced sufficiently.

ARP would like to understand how experienced suppliers in the marketplace feel these requirements might best be met and is therefore carrying out a soft market testing exercise to engage in early informal dialogue prior to any formal procurement taking place. ARP are open to discussion on all potential models of service delivery.

Initial findings suggests that there are three core available delivery options, and ARP welcomes feedback on these.

Commercial off-the-shelf devices (COTS) – This is a possible option, but it is not believed that there is a COTS device available that fully meets ARP’s requirements.

Bespoke - Product development either through slight enhancements of current COTS devices or complete ground-up development

Dual mode – ESN and TETRA

We would also welcome options on how to accessorise a COTs device to meet the requirement in a single form factor.

Any information provided will be strictly confidential and non-binding.

The Service will provide timely and appropriate access to advice, diagnosis, treatment and follow up that meets patients’ physical and psychological needs. It will contribute to the delivery of an efficient local Dermatology health system for people registered with a Calderdale General Practice. The Service will operate through a fully integrated, accessible model of care for people, ensuring the specialist elements of the service are delivered within a high quality and cost effective framework through the effective and sustainable use of resources, and streamlined referral and management processes.

The Service will be provided by a consultant-led multidisciplinary team which offers:
• Clinical triage assessment and treatment
• Advice, diagnosis, care and treatment in line with national standards
• Shared decision making, based on the NHS comprehensive model of personalised care
• Self-management as a core element of agreed care plans
• Cohesive and seamless pathways based on patient need
• Support for the delivery of high quality cancer services in line with national guidance

PIP is a DWP benefit which is intended to compensate for the extra costs of being disabled and support people to live independently. It is available to those in and out of work and is not means tested. PIP also functions as a gateway to other benefits and support in both DWP administered benefits, most notably additional premia in ESA, Carer’s Allowance and also wider services, including the Motability scheme and local authority services.

To support the determination of someone’s entitlement to benefit, DWP requires the delivery of PIP Disability Assessments. Through objective and independent assessment, DWP can ensure that support is targeted at those who need it most and that the levels and type of support provided to individuals reflects their circumstances. These assessments are then passed to a DWP Case Manager who will make the decision on entitlement on behalf of the Secretary of State.

The purpose of this contract is to make recommendations for a small set of key GI benchmarks / indicators and associated mapping datasets for use by local authorities and other GI stakeholders to support the emerging National Framework of Green Infrastructure Standards.



Background to Contract

Delivering a National Framework of GI Standards is a commitment in the Government’s 25-year Environment Plan (25YEP) and Natural England is leading a two-year project to develop, test and refine the Standards and Guidance for launch in Winter 2020/Spring 2021.  

The aims of the GI Standards Project are:

•	to mainstream GI as essential infrastructure in place-making, and in associated planning and land use decisions.   
•	to deliver more good quality, interconnected GI, at a local and landscape scale, that provides the multiple benefits communities need and want, consistently across England, and in particular for disadvantaged urban populations.


Contract Aims

Biodiversity is declining across the world faster than at any other time in human history. In the past 50 years, human pressures have increased while populations of animals, on average, have more than halved. The global rate of species extinction is already at least tens to hundreds of times higher than the average rate over the past 10 million years and is accelerating. Drivers of biodiversity loss include habitat loss and land use change (including urban development and agricultural intensification), pollution, invasive species, unsustainable resource use and climate change.

To address the challenges facing nature today, the UK Prime Minister announced at the 2019 UN General Assembly a £220 million International Biodiversity Fund. This includes a new £100m Biodiverse Landscapes Fund to restore key landscapes and their ecosystems. 

The joint Defra-DFID Biodiverse Landscapes Fund will deliver lasting protection and improvement of biodiversity in five global biodiversity hotspots, by aligning nature conservation and human development objectives at a landscape scale. Each landscape will be eligible for up to £20m over 5 years. We intend to begin projects in two initial landscapes by April/May 2021, with the next three to begin 6-9 months later.

In the past 50 years, human pressures have increased while populations of animals, on average, have more than halved. The global rate of species extinction is already at least tens to hundreds of times higher than the average rate over the past 10 million years and is accelerating. Drivers of biodiversity loss include habitat loss and land use change (including urban development and agricultural intensification), pollution, invasive species, unsustainable resource use and climate change.\n\nTo address the challenges facing nature today, the UK Prime Minister announced at the 2019 UN General Assembly a £220 million International Biodiversity Fund. This includes a new £100m Biodiverse Landscapes Fund to restore key landscapes and their ecosystems. \n\nThe joint Defra-DFID Biodiverse Landscapes Fund will deliver lasting protection and improvement of biodiversity in five global biodiversity hotspots, by aligning nature conservation and human development objectives at a landscape scale. Each landscape will be eligible for up to £20m over 5 years. We intend to begin projects in two initial landscapes by April/May 2021, with the next three to begin 6-9 months later.\n\nEarly Market Engagement (EME) Event\nWe are hosting an information day for interested potential delivery partners on Monday 24th February 2020.
