3. 
Explanation
	Please explain in a clear and comprehensive manner why the award of the contract without prior publication in the Official Journal of the European Union is 
	lawful, by stating the relevant facts and, as appropriate, the conclusions of law in accordance with the directive: (500 words maximum)
	The Warrior Capability Sustainment Programme (WCSP) is part of the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) and intends to place a Contract with Lockheed Martin UK Ampthill Limited (LMUK) for the Manufacture and supply of Warrior 1 Vehicle updated with WCSP Capability vehicles. WCSP will upgrade the current Warrior to meet the requirements of the British Army and extend its scheduled Out of Service Date to 2040. The programme is concentrated on improving lethality, fightability and survivability.
The contract will include the production and supply of Warrior vehicles with the WCSP Upgrade (“the Upgraded Vehicles”), provisioning of consumables and management of the repair asset loop and maintainer training in relation to the WCSP Upgrade and operator training in relation to the Upgraded Vehicles as an option.  It is considered that this contract can be placed using the negotiated procedure without prior publication of a contract notice for technical reasons pursuant to Article 28(1)(e) of Directive 2009/81/EC (Regulation 16(1)(a)(ii) of the UK Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations 2011.)
Reasons for Single Sourcing Manufacture:


The design and manufacture of the Upgraded Vehicles was competed in 2009 and LMUK was the successful supplier in this competition. A contract for the design and demonstration of the Upgraded Vehicle, with options for manufacture, was granted to LMUK in 2011.  The demonstration phase of that contract is approaching completion. During the design and demonstration phases, LMUK has generated a technical data pack relating to the Upgraded Vehicles (the technical data pack).  MOD does not have the right to use the technical data pack.  The technical data pack is necessary to perform the manufacture of the Upgraded Vehicles within a level of risk which is tolerable to MOD.
Reasons for Single Sourcing Other Scope as Outlined Below:


LMUK is the only contractor which will have access to the necessary technical information to enable it to provide:


•	Provisioning of consumables and management of the repair asset loop for an initial 2-year period for the WCSP elements only.

WCSP will upgrade the current Warrior to meet the requirements of the British Army and extend its scheduled Out of Service Date to 2040. The programme is concentrated on improving lethality, fightability and survivability.\nThe contract will include the production and supply of Warrior vehicles with the WCSP Upgrade (“the Upgraded Vehicles”), provisioning of consumables and management of the repair asset loop and maintainer training in relation to the WCSP Upgrade and operator training in relation to the Upgraded Vehicles as an option.  It is considered that this contract can be placed using the negotiated procedure without prior publication of a contract notice for technical reasons pursuant to Article 28(1)(e) of Directive 2009/81/EC (Regulation 16(1)(a)(ii) of the UK Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations 2011.)\nReasons for Single Sourcing Manufacture:\n\n\nThe design and manufacture of the Upgraded Vehicles was competed in 2009 and LMUK was the successful supplier in this competition. A contract for the design and demonstration of the Upgraded Vehicle, with options for manufacture, was granted to LMUK in 2011.  The demonstration phase of that contract is approaching completion. During the design and demonstration phases, LMUK has generated a technical data pack relating to the Upgraded Vehicles (the technical data pack).  MOD does not have the right to use the technical data pack.  The technical data pack is necessary to perform the manufacture of the Upgraded Vehicles within a level of risk which is tolerable to MOD.\nReasons for Single Sourcing Other Scope as Outlined Below:\n\n\nLMUK is the only contractor which will have access to the necessary technical information to enable it to provide:\n\n\n•\tProvisioning of consumables and management of the repair asset loop for an initial 2-year period for the WCSP elements only.\n•\tTechnical and maintainer support for 14 vehicles only.\n•\tMaintainer Train the Trainer (T3) package and provision of training equipment and course material in relation to the WCSP upgrade.\n•\tAn option to provide training equipment and course material to enable an initial period of operator training in relation to the WCSP upgrade."", ""tenderPeriod"": {""startDate"": ""2020-04-23T00:00:00+00:00""}, ""procuringEntity"": {""name"": ""Ministry of Defence""}}, ""language"": ""en"", ""initiationType"": ""tender""}], ""publisher"": {""uid"": ""https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/04962733"", ""uri"": ""https://openopps.com"", ""name"": ""Open Opps"", ""scheme"": ""Companies House""}, ""publishedDate"": ""2020-05-08T01:30:35.795450+00:00"", ""publicationPolicy"": ""https://openopps.com/legal/""}",2020-04-23 00:00:00.000000

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

As used in this clause—“Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database” means the retired primary Government repository for Contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government.“Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code” means—  (1)  A code assigned by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Logistics Information Service to identify a commercial or Government entity; or  (2)  A code assigned by a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that DLA records and maintains in the CAGE master file. This type of code is known as an “NCAGE code.”“Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number” means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&B) to identify unique business entities.“Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number” means the DUNS number means the number assigned by D&B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same concern.“Registered in the SAM database” means that—  (1)  The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the SAM database;   (2)  The Contractor’s CAGE code is in the SAM database; and   (3)  The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record “Active”. The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process.“System for Award Management (SAM)” means the primary Government repository for prospective federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance related processes.  It includes—  (1)  Data collected from prospective federal awardees required for the conduct of business with the Government;  (2)  Prospective contractor submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR Subpart 4.12; and  (3)  The list of all parties suspended, proposed for debarment, debarred, declared ineligible, or excluded or disqualified under the nonprocurement common rule by agencies, Government corporations, or by the Government Accountability Office.(b)(1)  The Contractor shall be registered in the SAM database prior to submitting an invoice and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.  (2)  The SAM registration shall be for the same name and address identified on the contract, with its associated CAGE code and DUNS or DUNS+4.  (3)  If indicated by the Government during performance, registration in an alternate system may be required in lieu of SAM.(c)  If the Contractor does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one.(1)	 A contractor may obtain a DUNS number—    (i)  Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or    (ii)  If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. The contractor should indicate that it is a contractor for a U.S. Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.  (2)  The Contractor should be prepared to provide the following information:    (i)  Company legal business name.    (ii)  Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized.    (iii)  Company physical street address, city, state and Zip Code.    (iv)  Company mailing address, city, state and Zip Code (if separate from physical).    (v)  Company telephone number.    (vi)  Date the company was started.    (vii)  Number of employees at your location.    (viii)  Chief executive officer/key manager.    (ix)  Line of business (industry).    (x)  Company Headquarters name and address (reporting relationship within your entity).(d)  Reserved.(e)  Processing time for registration in SAM, which normally takes five business days, should be taken into consideration when registering.  Contractors who are not already registered should consider applying for registration at least two weeks prior to invoicing.(f)  The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government’s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.(g)(1)(i)  If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, “doing business as” name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name with a minimum of one business day’s written notification of its intention to—      (A)  Change the name in the SAM database;       (B)  Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and      (C)  Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.     (ii)  If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of Payment” paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.    (2)  The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database.  Information provided to the Contractor’s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of payment” paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (h)  Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.(End of Clause)DescriptionAMENDMENT NOTICE: This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.

Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive.This clause implements the temporary policy provided by OMB Policy Memorandum M-12-16, Providing Prompt Payment to Small Business Subcontractors, dated July 11, 2012

(a) Upon receipt of accelerated payments from the Government, the contractor is required to make accelerated payments to small business subcontractors to the maximum extent practicable after receipt of a proper invoice and all proper documentation from the small business subcontractor.

(b) Inclue the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (b), in all subcontracts with small business concerns.

(c) The acceleration of payments under this clause does not provide any new rights under the Prompt Payment Act.(a)  Definitions.  As used in this clause—

“Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database” means the retired primary Government repository for Contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government.

“Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code” means—

  (1)  A code assigned by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Logistics Information Service to identify a commercial or Government entity; or

  (2)  A code assigned by a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that DLA records and maintains in the CAGE master file. This type of code is known as an “NCAGE code.”

“Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number” means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&B) to identify unique business entities.

“Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number” means the DUNS number means the number assigned by D&B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same concern.

“Registered in the SAM database” means that—

  (1)  The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the SAM database; 

  (2)  The Contractor’s CAGE code is in the SAM database; and 

  (3)  The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record “Active”. The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process.“System for Award Management (SAM)” means the primary Government repository for prospective federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance related processes.  It includes—

  (1)  Data collected from prospective federal awardees required for the conduct of business with the Government;

  (2)  Prospective contractor submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR Subpart 4.12; and

  (3)  The list of all parties suspended, proposed for debarment, debarred, declared ineligible, or excluded or disqualified under the nonprocurement common rule by agencies, Government corporations, or by the Government Accountability Office.

(b)(1)  The Contractor shall be registered in the SAM database prior to submitting an invoice and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.

  (2)  The SAM registration shall be for the same name and address identified on the contract, with its associated CAGE code and DUNS or DUNS+4.

  (3)  If indicated by the Government during performance, registration in an alternate system may be required in lieu of SAM.

(c)  If the Contractor does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one.

(1)	 A contractor may obtain a DUNS number—

    (i)  Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or

    (ii)  If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. The contractor should indicate that it is a contractor for a U.S. Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.


  (2)  The Contractor should be prepared to provide the following information:

    (i)  Company legal business name.

    (ii)  Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized.

    (iii)  Company physical street address, city, state and Zip Code.

    (iv)  Company mailing address, city, state and Zip Code (if separate from physical).

    (v)  Company telephone number.

    (vi)  Date the company was started.

    (vii)  Number of employees at your location.

    (viii)  Chief executive officer/key manager.

    (ix)  Line of business (industry).

    (x)  Company Headquarters name and address (reporting relationship within your entity).

(d)  Reserved.

(e)  Processing time for registration in SAM, which normally takes five business days, should be taken into consideration when registering.  Contractors who are not already registered should consider applying for registration at least two weeks prior to invoicing.(f)  The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government’s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.

(g)(1)(i)  If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, “doing business as” name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name with a minimum of one business day’s written notification of its intention to—

      (A)  Change the name in the SAM database; 

      (B)  Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and

      (C)  Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. 

    (ii)  If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of Payment” paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. 

   (2)  The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database.  Information provided to the Contractor’s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of payment” paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. 

(h)  Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.

As used in this clause—\n\n“Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database” means the retired primary Government repository for Contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government.\n\n“Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code” means—\n\n  (1)  A code assigned by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Logistics Information Service to identify a commercial or Government entity; or\n\n  (2)  A code assigned by a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that DLA records and maintains in the CAGE master file. This type of code is known as an “NCAGE code.”\n\n“Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number” means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&B) to identify unique business entities.\n\n“Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number” means the DUNS number means the number assigned by D&B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same concern.\n\n“Registered in the SAM database” means that—\n\n  (1)  The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the SAM database; \n\n  (2)  The Contractor’s CAGE code is in the SAM database; and \n\n  (3)  The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record “Active”. The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process.“System for Award Management (SAM)” means the primary Government repository for prospective federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance related processes.  It includes—\n\n  (1)  Data collected from prospective federal awardees required for the conduct of business with the Government;\n\n  (2)  Prospective contractor submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR Subpart 4.12; and\n\n  (3)  The list of all parties suspended, proposed for debarment, debarred, declared ineligible, or excluded or disqualified under the nonprocurement common rule by agencies, Government corporations, or by the Government Accountability Office.\n\n(b)(1)  The Contractor shall be registered in the SAM database prior to submitting an invoice and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.\n\n  (2)  The SAM registration shall be for the same name and address identified on the contract, with its associated CAGE code and DUNS or DUNS+4.\n\n  (3)  If indicated by the Government during performance, registration in an alternate system may be required in lieu of SAM.\n\n(c)  If the Contractor does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one.\n\n(1)\t A contractor may obtain a DUNS number—\n\n    (i)  Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or\n\n    (ii)  If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. The contractor should indicate that it is a contractor for a U.S. Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.\n\n\n  (2)  The Contractor should be prepared to provide the following information:\n\n    (i)  Company legal business name.\n\n    (ii)  Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized.\n\n    (iii)  Company physical street address, city, state and Zip Code.\n\n    (iv)  Company mailing address, city, state and Zip Code (if separate from physical).\n\n    (v)  Company telephone number.\n\n    (vi)  Date the company was started.\n\n    (vii)  Number of employees at your location.\n\n    (viii)  Chief executive officer/key manager.\n\n    (ix)  Line of business (industry).\n\n    (x)  Company Headquarters name and address (reporting relationship within your entity).\n\n(d)  Reserved.\n\n(e)  Processing time for registration in SAM, which normally takes five business days, should be taken into consideration when registering.  Contractors who are not already registered should consider applying for registration at least two weeks prior to invoicing.(f)  The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government’s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.\n\n(g)(1)(i)  If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, “doing business as” name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name with a minimum of one business day’s written notification of its intention to—\n\n      (A)  Change the name in the SAM database; \n\n      (B)  Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and\n\n      (C)  Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. \n\n    (ii)  If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of Payment” paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. \n\n   (2)  The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database.  Information provided to the Contractor’s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of payment” paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. \n\n(h)  Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.\n\n(End of Clause)"", ""tenderPeriod"": {""startDate"": ""2020-04-23T17:25:00+00:00""}}, ""language"": ""en"", ""initiationType"": ""tender""}], ""publisher"": {""uid"": ""https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/04962733"", ""uri"": ""https://openopps.com"", ""name"": ""Open Opps"", ""scheme"": ""Companies House""}, ""publishedDate"": ""2020-04-26T01:35:51.329222+00:00"", ""publicationPolicy"": ""https://openopps.com/legal/""}",2020-04-25 12:24:30.381279

Going forward, all new entities registering in GSA's System for Award Management (SAM), as well as existing registrations being updated or renewed, will require the submission of an original, signed notarized letter identifying the authorized Entity Administrator for the entity associated with the Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number.  Effective June 11, 2018, entities who create or update their registration in SAM.gov to apply only for federal assistance opportunities such as grants, loans, and other financial assistance programs, have a notarized letter on file within 30 days of registration.  Additionally, Effective June 29, 2018, all non-Federal entities who create or update their registration in SAM.gov, have a notarized letter on file within 30 days of registration.  It is recommended that all interested parties be aware that processing this additional information may take several days and are proactive in maintaining the SAM registrations in an ""Active"" status as the government cannot award to an entity without an ""Active"" SAM registration.

Background Information 
The New York District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) proposes to perform maintenance dredging of Cheesequake Creek, New Jersey, Federal Navigation Project to a depth of -5 feet Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW) plus 2 foot over-depth.  The dredged material would be processed and subsequently transported to and placed, at a suitable, state permitted upland placement site(s).  The proposed maintenance dredging would remove approximately 9,000 cubic yards (CY) of critical shoals from Cheesequake Creek.  The dredged material is expected to consist of greater than 98% gravel and sand. 

Due to possible restrictions in the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection Water Quality Certificate, the proposed work may be required to only be performed by utilizing a mechanical dredge with a closed clamshell environmental bucket. Additionally, multiple scows and tug boats will be needed to perform the work during the dredging, dewatering and unloading operations.  The dredged material would be required to meet all federal, state, and approved local criteria required by the government agencies having jurisdiction where the dredging and placement sites are located. 

The apparent low bidder shall, within 35 calendar days from the date the apparent low bidder is notified of being such, provide copies of all required permits and approvals for transfer, transportation, dewatering, and/or processing, and final placement of the dredged material, and shall submit evidence of such permits and approvals to the government.

Once the contract is awarded, the contractor will be required to commence work within five (5) calendar days after the date of receipt by him of the notice to proceed and maintain an integrated production rate of at least 1,000 cubic yards per calendar day for the dredging, transfer, transportation, dewatering and/or other processing, and final placement of the material.  The presence of dredging equipment in the channel will impact vessel traffic and it is necessary to maintain this production rate while minimizing the duration of this impact.
The proposed work is anticipated to take place in July, August, September, or October 2020.  The work is estimated to cost between $1,000,000.00 and $5,000,000.00.
Liquidated damages of $2,020 per calendar day of delay will be assessed to the contractor until all work under the contract is accepted as complete.
This is an unrestricted procurement. Please refer to solicitation attached for instructions regarding online bid submissions.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 13.105, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

This solicitation number is 70B03C20Q00000088 and is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ). The solicitation documentation and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2020-02. The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 311991 – Perishable Prepared Food Manufacturing, with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  This requirement is a Total Small Business set-aside, and only qualified Quoters may submit quotes.  Prospective Quoters are required to identify their company’s business size and certify that they hold the applicable NAICS code.

Emailed responses are requested to be received by the BPA Contracting Officer (CO) Frank S. Duarte at the following address by no later than May 5th, 2020, 1:00 P.M. Eastern Standard Time (EST): frank.s.duarte@cbp.dhs.gov.

*** Question Submission: Interested Quoters must submit any questions concerning the solicitation at the earliest time possible to enable the Agency to respond, but no questions shall be accepted after April 27th, 2020 3:30 P.M. EST.  Questions must be submitted directly to the BPA CO at the email address indicated on this notice. ***
 
Description of the Requirement
 
Supplier shall furnish Detainee Meals as described and outlined in the attached Statement of Work (SOW), during the ordering period specified, to the US Customs and Border Protection Agency, US Border Patrol (USBP) and Office of Field Operations (OFO) locations as indicated.  Upon award of a BPA, requirements shall be furnished if and when requested by the individual Ordering Contracting Officer or authorized Government Representative acting within their scope of delegated procurement authority, as outlined in the attached BPA Ordering Guide, and for their respective locations.

The US Customs and Border Protection Agency intends to establish a multi-award Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) to fulfill this requirement; however, the Government reserves the right to not award any BPA and does not guarantee any order placements. The resultant BPA award will be five (5) years in duration with an aggregate total Not-To-Exceed ceiling amount of $208,233,544.37.  The Government anticipates award of a BPA within 45 days of receipt of quotes.  The Government is obligated only to the extent of the authorized purchases made under the BPA.

BPA Ordering Period

The ordering period of this multi-award BPA shall be for a total of five (5) years or up to the maximum order limitation of $208,233,544.37, whichever limit is reached sooner.  Pricing quotes shall be provided in Attachment 3 (BPA Pricing Sheet) (one per location) for the ordering periods below:

July 13, 2020 – July 12, 2021
July 13, 2021 – July 12, 2022
July 13, 2022 – July 12, 2023
July 13, 2023 – July 12, 2024
July 13, 2024 – July 12, 2025

The BPA will be reviewed annually at each anniversary to determine if the BPA will continue.


GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE PREPARATION OF QUOTES


CBP will conduct a streamlined evaluation of all received quotes for establishing the multiple award BPAs, as outlined in the attached BPA Solicitation Provisions and Clauses document, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference. CBP reserves the right to establish a BPA without further communication and exchange; therefore, each response to this request should contain the Quoter’s best pricing, terms, and conditions. Quotes must be prepared in accordance with these instructions and provide all required information in the format specified.  The required format is designed to ensure submission of information essential to the understanding and comprehensive evaluation of the vendor's quote.  Failure of a quote to comply with these instructions may be grounds for exclusion of the quote from further consideration. Any exceptions taken with respect to the clauses in the solicitation shall be noted.  For the purpose of facilitating exchanges, for every instance where the vendor does not propose to comply with or agree to a requirement, the vendor shall propose an alternative and describe its reasoning therefor.

Each prospective Quoter shall include in its submission one or more (with a maximum of 13) fully completed BPA Pricing Sheets using the template attached to this notice.  The number of BPA Pricing Sheets required will depend on the number of locations included in the Quote.  Failure to comply with this term may result in the quote being determined to be non-responsive.

In addition to providing pricing for this solicitation, each Quoter must also provide any required, NON-PRICING responses as follows:

Technical Proposal (10 pages maximum): Full menu of items to be provided; Distribution methodology; Food Safety Plan/Quality Control Plan; Completed representations and certifications; Certification that quoted menus meet or exceed USDA nutritional guidelines; Business health certifications.
	 
Past Performance (5 pages maximum): Information on historical provision of same or similar requirements as indicated.


Submissions shall be in electronic format and sent to the BPA CO listed on this solicitation in accordance with the provision entitled “Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items,” which applies to this solicitation.

Emailed submissions must be in separate attachments and clearly indicate what is being provided.  The Government reserves the right to disregard any additional attachments without notification to any Quoter.  Subject line of the email should read “70B03C20Q00000088 SWB Detainee Meals BPA.”

Due to CBP restrictions on the size of email, ensure that all emails submitted are less than 5MB.  If the quote exceeds 5MB, please separate the submission into multiple emails and include in the subject line the solicitation number and # of # emails.  Any electronic submission determined to contain a virus will be deleted and not viewed or accepted for consideration under this solicitation.

Submissions must be received no later than the exact time specified in this solicitation to be considered for award.  Time of receipt will be determined by the government’s email receipt time.  It is the quoting firm’s responsibility to ensure this is done according to the above restrictions.

Quotes MUST be good for 60 calendar days after close of solicitation.

This solicitation requires registration with the System for Award Management (SAM) prior to award, pursuant to applicable regulations and guidelines. Registration information can be found at https://www.sam.gov/SAM/.

Topic 
1) Phase In/Phase out (Transition In/Transition Out) : 
The Government past experience with transition of complete new inventory at the start and end of contract is a weakness that the Government would like addressed and included in the future solicitation. 
Currently we have contractor appliances installed at MCRD that will need to be removed by outgoing contractor. 
MCRD only allows commercial deliveries 4 weekdays per week. The installation must be done only when all appliances for a laundry room are available.  MCRD anticipates that the current/future vendor will be allowed to use a warehouse space for short term storage of appliances.  
If a vendor has any ideas to help the government better define the Phase In/Phase out (Transition In/Transition Out) - please respond to this RFI.
If a vendor has a contract that provided a good definition of requirements for this transition period - please provide contract number or contracting point of contract information. 
 
2) Installation issue
As required by the manufacturer, 30 lbs heavy duty washers must be properly secured to the floor with cement anchors and grouting - the Government anticipates the vendor will be required to perform this work.  In estimating the cost of this requirement, the Government is seeking to know the level of effort.  Approximately how many labor hours are required per washer?  The Government is assuming an Appliance Service Technician would be required for this task.  Reference https://www.onetonline.org/link/summary/49-9031.00

Contract No. N00178-15-D-2017 is an Indefinite Delivery Requirements (IDIQ) type contract that was awarded on 28 May 2015 to IXI Technology, Inc. (IXI), formerly Sabtech Industries, Inc., 23231 La Palma Ave, Yorba Linda CA 92887-4768, through other than full and open competition in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). The requirement was synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FEDBIZOPS) website as a sole source requirement on 08 August 2014 in accordance with FAR 5.202.
This requirement is for various highly specialized, critical and essential Navy Tactical Data System (NTDS) interface boards, Inter-range Instrumentation Group (IRIG) timing cards, adapter module and cables, Sabtech Military Equipment Simulators (SMILES) systems, and Sabtech Peripherals Replacement Systems (SPRS) PowerNet NTDS converters. IXI Technology is the developer and singular responsible source that can provide the necessary equipment and meet the critical requirements of successful testing, existing accreditation, and availability within the mission-critical delivery and deployment timeframe. This action is extending the ordering period on our final buy out of a technology that is going towards obsolescence.
This extension will be accomplished in accordance with FAR 43.103(a)(3) Mutual Agreement of the Parties which is pursuant to DFARS 217.204(e)(i) stating “the ordering period of a task order or delivery order contract … (B) may be subsequently extended for one or more successive periods in accordance with an option provided in the contract or a modification of the contract.”
The current ordering period for all contracted CLINS is 22 May 2015 to 21 May 2020. The adjusted ordering period shall extend the current ordering by 18 months and have an end date of 21 November 2021. This notice is NOT a request for competitive proposals.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

Use of Unison Marketplace:   Buyers and Sellers agree to conduct this transaction through Unison Marketplace in compliance with the Unison Marketplace Terms of Use. Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive.This clause implements the temporary policy provided by OMB Policy Memorandum M-12-16, Providing Prompt Payment to Small Business Subcontractors, dated July 11, 2012\n\n(a) Upon receipt of accelerated payments from the Government, the contractor is required to make accelerated payments to small business subcontractors to the maximum extent practicable after receipt of a proper invoice and all proper documentation from the small business subcontractor.\n\n(b) Inclue the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (b), in all subcontracts with small business concerns.\n\n(c) The acceleration of payments under this clause does not provide any new rights under the Prompt Payment Act.(a)  Definitions.  As used in this clause—\n\n“Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database” means the retired primary Government repository for Contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government.\n\n“Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code” means—\n\n  (1)  A code assigned by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Logistics Information Service to identify a commercial or Government entity; or\n\n  (2)  A code assigned by a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that DLA records and maintains in the CAGE master file. This type of code is known as an “NCAGE code.”\n\n“Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number” means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&B) to identify unique business entities.\n\n“Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number” means the DUNS number means the number assigned by D&B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same concern.\n\n“Registered in the SAM database” means that—\n\n  (1)  The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the SAM database; \n\n  (2)  The Contractor’s CAGE code is in the SAM database; and \n\n  (3)  The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record “Active”. The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process.“System for Award Management (SAM)” means the primary Government repository for prospective federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance related processes.  It includes—\n\n  (1)  Data collected from prospective federal awardees required for the conduct of business with the Government;\n\n  (2)  Prospective contractor submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR Subpart 4.12; and\n\n  (3)  The list of all parties suspended, proposed for debarment, debarred, declared ineligible, or excluded or disqualified under the nonprocurement common rule by agencies, Government corporations, or by the Government Accountability Office.\n\n(b)(1)  The Contractor shall be registered in the SAM database prior to submitting an invoice and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.\n\n  (2)  The SAM registration shall be for the same name and address identified on the contract, with its associated CAGE code and DUNS or DUNS+4.\n\n  (3)  If indicated by the Government during performance, registration in an alternate system may be required in lieu of SAM.\n\n(c)  If the Contractor does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one.\n\n(1)\t A contractor may obtain a DUNS number—\n\n    (i)  Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or\n\n    (ii)  If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. The contractor should indicate that it is a contractor for a U.S. Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.\n\n\n  (2)  The Contractor should be prepared to provide the following information:\n\n    (i)  Company legal business name.\n\n    (ii)  Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized.\n\n    (iii)  Company physical street address, city, state and Zip Code.\n\n    (iv)  Company mailing address, city, state and Zip Code (if separate from physical).\n\n    (v)  Company telephone number.\n\n    (vi)  Date the company was started.\n\n    (vii)  Number of employees at your location.\n\n    (viii)  Chief executive officer/key manager.\n\n    (ix)  Line of business (industry).\n\n    (x)  Company Headquarters name and address (reporting relationship within your entity).\n\n(d)  Reserved.\n\n(e)  Processing time for registration in SAM, which normally takes five business days, should be taken into consideration when registering.  Contractors who are not already registered should consider applying for registration at least two weeks prior to invoicing.(f)  The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government’s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.\n\n(g)(1)(i)  If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, “doing business as” name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name with a minimum of one business day’s written notification of its intention to—\n\n      (A)  Change the name in the SAM database; \n\n      (B)  Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and\n\n      (C)  Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. \n\n    (ii)  If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of Payment” paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. \n\n   (2)  The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database.  Information provided to the Contractor’s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of payment” paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. \n\n(h)  Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.\n\n(End of Clause)"", ""tenderPeriod"": {""startDate"": ""2020-04-22T11:17:00+00:00""}}, ""language"": ""en"", ""initiationType"": ""tender""}], ""publisher"": {""uid"": ""https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/04962733"", ""uri"": ""https://openopps.com"", ""name"": ""Open Opps"", ""scheme"": ""Companies House""}, ""publishedDate"": ""2020-04-26T01:35:42.995424+00:00"", ""publicationPolicy"": ""https://openopps.com/legal/""}",2020-04-25 12:24:30.381279

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

52.212-2 Evaluation---Commercial Items (Oct 2014).

(a)The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Quoter whose quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.
The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotes:

1)Price; and
2)Technical Acceptability 

Quoters shall utilize the excel spreadsheet at Attachment 4 for their quote submittal. 

While price is a significant factor in the evaluation of quotes, the final award will be based on a combination of the lowest price technically acceptable and availability. 

Price: An award will be made to the lowest price responsible Quoter submitting a technically acceptable quote. 

Technical Acceptability: To be considered technically acceptable, the Quoter must quote on the required time slots and provide the required number of buses in the attachments of this solicitation. The required time slots and number of buses that can be provided must be filled in, even if the number is a 0 utilizing the spreadsheet provided at Attachment 4.

Technical Acceptability will be rated on an “acceptable” or “unacceptable” basis using the ratings in the table below.

The Contracting Officer will rank quotes from lowest to highest price, and review the technical quotes of the three lowest priced quotes first.
If the lowest price quote is technically acceptable and can meet all of the bus requirements identified in Attachments I and 2, then award will be made to the lowest priced quote.

In the event that none of the quotes received in response to the solicitation meet all of the requirements identified in Attachments 1 and 2, the quotes will then be evaluated by hourly rate and number of buses per hour. The Quoter(s) with the lowest hourly rate for a particular time slot will be awarded that slot OR portion of the slot until the required number of buses is reached.

If the required number is still not reached, the Government will continue to evaluate next lowest priced quote until all of its requirements are met.
Thus, the Government may award more than one separate BPA calls to responsible Quoter(s) in response to this one solicitation. The Quoter shall provide an on island point-of-contact (POC) for coordination purposes.

By responding to this combined synopsis/solicitation, the offeror is acknowledging agreement with terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.

Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is “late” and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made.

The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror’s initial offer should contain the offeror’s best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.

GSA Contract Number (If applicable): 
Unique entity identifier: (Applies to all offers exceeding the micro-purchase threshold and offers at any dollar value if the solicitation requires the Contractor to be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database.) The Offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation “Unique Entity Identifier” followed by the unique entity identifier that identifies the Offeror's name and address. The Offeror also shall enter its Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) indicator, if applicable. The EFT indicator is a four-character suffix to the unique entity identifier. The suffix is assigned at the discretion of the Offeror to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative EFT accounts (see subpart 32.11) for the same entity. If the Offeror does not have a unique entity identifier, it should contact the entity designated at www.sam.gov for unique entity identifier establishment directly to obtain one. The Offeror should indicate that it is an offeror for a Government contract when contacting the entity designated at www.sam.gov for establishing the unique entity identifier.

If a post-award debriefing is given to requesting offerors, the Government shall disclose the following information, if applicable:

The agency’s evaluation of the significant weak or deficient factors in the debriefed offeror’s offer. The overall evaluated cost or price and technical rating of the successful and debriefed offeror and past performance information on the debriefed offeror. The overall ranking of all offerors, when any ranking was developed by the agency during source selection. A summary of rationale for award. For acquisitions of commercial items, the make and model of the item to be delivered by the successful offeror. Reasonable responses to relevant questions posed by the debriefed offeror as to whether source-selection procedures set forth in the solicitation, applicable regulations, and other applicable authorities were followed by the agency. 

(End of Provision)

52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items.
As prescribed in 12.301(c), the Contracting Officer may insert a provision substantially as follows:
Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Oct 2014)

(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: TECHNICAL ACCEPTABILITY and PRICE 

(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer’s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

The Corps of Engineers New York District is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of a Project Labor Agreement (PLA) for the following large scale (exceeding $25 million) construction project:

Repair, UPH, Soldier Barracks, Building 620, United States Military Academy, West Point, NY

Project Description: This project entails a comprehensive repair of all building infrastructure and systems throughout the barracks (Building 620) to include Mechanical, Electrical, Plumbing (MEP) systems; Communication systems; Fire Protection systems, equipment, components, and configuration; Architectural Components; Structural components; Interior circulation, egress, space configuration, finishes, and fixtures; Exterior Envelope; Roofing and Exterior Drainage; and Security Systems. The building repairs will address the removal of hazardous materials; replacing deteriorated utility systems; and space planning for new configurations which adhere to safety and quality of life standards outlined in Army Regulation (AR210-50).

Range of Magnitude: Between $25,000,000 to $100,000,000.

Period of Performance:  Approximately 605 calendar days after Notice to Proceed.  Notice to Proceed is anticipated to occur August 2020.

Some of the factors that may be considered regarding PLA use are:

a. The involvement of multiple contractors and/or subcontractors working in multiple crafts or trades.
b. The complexity of the project.
c. Shortage of skilled labor in the region.
d. Completion of the project will require an extended period of time.
e. The use of PLA's on other comparable projects in this geographic area.
f. The promotion of the Governments long term programs interests such as training of skilled workforce for future projects.
g. The possibility of labor disputes that threaten timely completion.
h. Additional costs from use of PLAs may be cost prohibitive.

A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f).

Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy:

a. Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.

b. An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will

1. Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and

2. Be consistent with law.

Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.

In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions:

a. Should a PLA be executed on the above described construction project? What benefits do you believe a PLA could achieve?  What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions for the Repair, UPH, Soldier Barracks, Building 620 project?

b. Will the use of a PLA be effective in achieving economy and efficiency?   If so, how?  What is the estimated relative cost impact, or any other economies or efficiencies derived by the Federal Government, if using a PLA? Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer?

c. Are there any concerns regarding labor-management stability related to this project? Will the use of a PLA produce labor-management stability on this project?  Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area?  Are you aware of examples of labor-management conflicts in the area which could impact the efficiency of this project, which a PLA could positively impact/resolve?  What market share does union labor in construction trades have in the geographic area?  Which existing Collective Bargaining Agreements will expire during construction of this project?

d. Will use of a PLA be conducive to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other relevant matters on this project? Are there instances where these standards have not been met on Federal contracts in the local area? Were PLAs used for those specific contracts?

e. This project will require construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing workers in multiple crafts or trades. Do you foresee any work on this project that may result in both the prime contractor and at least one subcontractor, or two or more subcontractors, employing the same trade?

f. Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? Are there large scale construction projects in the area (over $25M, within 50 miles of the five New York City Boroughs) which could impact availability of skilled labor for this project? What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the trades required for the execution of the project?  Are existing apprentice programs providing sufficient numbers of skilled workers for future requirements?

g. Is the proposed schedule/completion time one which would benefit from a PLA – if so, how? Will a PLA impact the completion time? Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?

h. Have comparable projects been undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in the geographic area of this project?  For each project, please indicate if a PLA was used, the initial and final cost, number of trades on the project, if the project was completed on time, and if there were any challenges such as labor shortages, labor related delays, safety issues, etc..

i. Will the use of PLAs impact the ability of potential Offerors and subcontractors to meet small-business utilization goals?

The nonmanufacturer rule and the limitations on subcontracting apply to all SDVOSB and VOSB set asides and sole source contracts.  Service-disabled Veteran  means a Veteran, as defined in 38 U.S.C. 101(2), with a disability that is service-connected, as defined in 38 U.S.C. 101(16). (b) General. (1) Offers are solicited only from eligible service-disabled Veteran-owned small business concerns. Only VIP-listed service-disabled Veteran-owned small business concerns (SDVOSBs) may submit offers in response to this solicitation. Offers received from concerns that are not VIP-listed service-disabled Veteran-owned small business concerns shall not be considered. (2) Any award resulting from this solicitation shall be made to a VIP-listed service-disabled Veteran-owned small business concern that meets the size standard for the applicable NAICS code. (c) Representation. By submitting an offer, the prospective contractor represents that it is an eligible SDVOSB as defined in this clause, 38 CFR part 74, and VAAR subpart 819.70. Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 8127(e), only VIP-listed SDVOSBs are considered eligible. Therefore, any reference in 13 CFR part 121 and 125 to a service-disabled Veteran-owned small business concern (SDVO SBC), is to be construed to apply to a VA verified and VIP-listed SDVOSB and only such concern(s) qualify as similarly situated. The offeror must also be eligible at the time of award. (d) Agreement.  When awarded a contract (see FAR 2.101, Definitions), including orders under multiple-award contracts, or a subcontract, an SDVOSB agrees that in the performance of the contract, the SDVOSB shall comply with requirements in VAAR subpart 819.70 and SBA regulations on small business size and government contracting programs at 13 CFR part 121 and 125, including the nonmanufacturer rule and limitations on subcontracting requirements in 13 CFR part 121.406 and 125.6, provided that for purposes of the limitations on subcontracting, only VIP-listed SDVOSBs shall be considered eligible and/or  similarly situated  (i.e., a firm that has the same small business program status as the prime contractor). An independent contractor shall be considered a subcontractor. An otherwise eligible firm further agrees to the following: (1) Services. In the case of a contract for services (except construction), it will not pay more than 50% of the amount paid by the government to it to firms that are not VIP-listed SDVOSBs.

(4) Special trade contractors. In the case of a contract for special trade contractors, it will not pay more than 75% of the amount paid by the government to it to firms that are not VIP-listed SDVOSBs. (5) Subcontracting. Any work that a VIP-listed SDVOSB subcontractor further subcontracts will count towards the percent of subcontract amount that cannot be exceeded. For supply or construction contracts, cost of materials is excluded and not considered to be subcontracted. For mixed contracts and additional limitations, refer to 13 CFR 125.6. (e) Joint ventures. A joint venture may be considered an SDVOSB if the joint venture is listed in VIP and complies with the requirements in 13 CFR 125.18(b), provided that any reference therein to service-disabled Veteran-owned small business concern or SDVO SBC, is to be construed to mean a VIP-listed SDVOSB. A joint venture agrees that, in the performance of the contract, the applicable percentage specified in paragraph (d) of this clause will be performed by the aggregate of the joint venture participants. (f) Precedence. For any inconsistencies between the requirements of the SBA program for service-disabled Veteran-owned small business concerns and the VA Veterans First Contract Program, as defined in VAAR subpart 819.70 and this clause, the VA Veterans First Contracting Program requirements have precedence.

The nonmanufacturer rule and the limitations on subcontracting apply to all SDVOSB and VOSB set asides and sole source contracts.  Service-disabled Veteran  means a Veteran, as defined in 38 U.S.C. 101(2), with a disability that is service-connected, as defined in 38 U.S.C. 101(16). (b) General. (1) Offers are solicited only from eligible service-disabled Veteran-owned small business concerns. Only VIP-listed service-disabled Veteran-owned small business concerns (SDVOSBs) may submit offers in response to this solicitation. Offers received from concerns that are not VIP-listed service-disabled Veteran-owned small business concerns shall not be considered. (2) Any award resulting from this solicitation shall be made to a VIP-listed service-disabled Veteran-owned small business concern that meets the size standard for the applicable NAICS code. (c) Representation. By submitting an offer, the prospective contractor represents that it is an eligible SDVOSB as defined in this clause, 38 CFR part 74, and VAAR subpart 819.70. Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 8127(e), only VIP-listed SDVOSBs are considered eligible. Therefore, any reference in 13 CFR part 121 and 125 to a service-disabled Veteran-owned small business concern (SDVO SBC), is to be construed to apply to a VA verified and VIP-listed SDVOSB and only such concern(s) qualify as similarly situated. The offeror must also be eligible at the time of award. (d) Agreement.  When awarded a contract (see FAR 2.101, Definitions), including orders under multiple-award contracts, or a subcontract, an SDVOSB agrees that in the performance of the contract, the SDVOSB shall comply with requirements in VAAR subpart 819.70 and SBA regulations on small business size and government contracting programs at 13 CFR part 121 and 125, including the nonmanufacturer rule and limitations on subcontracting requirements in 13 CFR part 121.406 and 125.6, provided that for purposes of the limitations on subcontracting, only VIP-listed SDVOSBs shall be considered eligible and/or  similarly situated  (i.e., a firm that has the same small business program status as the prime contractor). An independent contractor shall be considered a subcontractor. An otherwise eligible firm further agrees to the following: (1) Services. In the case of a contract for services (except construction), it will not pay more than 50% of the amount paid by the government to it to firms that are not VIP-listed SDVOSBs.

(4) Special trade contractors. In the case of a contract for special trade contractors, it will not pay more than 75% of the amount paid by the government to it to firms that are not VIP-listed SDVOSBs. (5) Subcontracting. Any work that a VIP-listed SDVOSB subcontractor further subcontracts will count towards the percent of subcontract amount that cannot be exceeded. For supply or construction contracts, cost of materials is excluded and not considered to be subcontracted. For mixed contracts and additional limitations, refer to 13 CFR 125.6. (e) Joint ventures. A joint venture may be considered an SDVOSB if the joint venture is listed in VIP and complies with the requirements in 13 CFR 125.18(b), provided that any reference therein to service-disabled Veteran-owned small business concern or SDVO SBC, is to be construed to mean a VIP-listed SDVOSB. A joint venture agrees that, in the performance of the contract, the applicable percentage specified in paragraph (d) of this clause will be performed by the aggregate of the joint venture participants. (f) Precedence. For any inconsistencies between the requirements of the SBA program for service-disabled Veteran-owned small business concerns and the VA Veterans First Contract Program, as defined in VAAR subpart 819.70 and this clause, the VA Veterans First Contracting Program requirements have precedence.

This procurement uses the two-phase design-build selection procedures and consists of one solicitation covering both phases with the intent to award three or more Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) construction contracts to the responsible offerors whose proposals, conforming to the Request for Proposal (RFP), will be most advantageous to the Government resulting in the best value, price and other factors considered. Price evaluation preference will be given to HUBZone firms, in accordance with FAR 52.219-4.
This is an IDIQ contract with no pre-established fixed contract prices. The actual amount of work to be performed and the time of such performance will be determined by the Contracting Officer or his properly authorized representative, who will issue written task orders to the contractor. Award of task orders will be on a firm fixed price basis. The work to be acquired under this solicitation is for new construction, renovation, and repair, by design-build or design-bid-build, of commercial and institutional building construction projects at various Government installations located in California, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, and New Mexico. The area of coverage may also extend to the entire NAVFAC area of responsibility (AOR) as approved by the NAVFAC Southwest (SW) Chief of Contracting Office (CCO). However, it is anticipated that the majority of the work will be performed in California.
Examples of relevant construction projects are construction projects similar in scope to: airport building, office/administrative building, communications facility, vehicle maintenance facility, armories, parking garage (paved parking lots will not be considered relevant), barracks facility, prison facility, fire station, religious building, hotel, dining facility, hospital/medical facilities, warehouse facility, school facility, and/or retail facility. For this solicitation, new construction and/or repair of single family homes will not be considered relevant.
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 236220, and the annual size standard is $39.5 million. The basic contract period will be for 24 months. Each contract contains one (1) 36-month option for a total maximum duration of 60 months. The estimated maximum dollar value, including the base and option periods, for all contracts combined is $2,500,000,000. The only work authorized under this contract is work ordered by the government through issuance of a task order. Task orders will range between $15,000,000 and $250,000,000. Task orders may fall below or above this limit; however, contractors are not obligated to accept such task orders under the general terms of the contract. The government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or actual amount of work to be ordered; however, during the term of the contract, a minimum of $5,000 is guaranteed to be ordered from each awardee, under the performance period of the contract. Contractors are not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee.
The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award contract(s) without discussions. Selection for award will be based on evaluation of the following:  Phase One:  Factor 1 - Technical Approach, Factor 2 - Experience, Factor 3 - Past Performance, and Factor 4 - Safety; Phase Two:  Factor 5 - Technical Solution (based on Proposed Task Order 0001), Factor 6 - Small Business Participation, and Factor 7 - Price (based on Proposed Task Order 0001). Source Selection procedures will be used and award may be made to the offeror whose proposal is the most advantageous and offers the best value to the government, price and other factors considered.

192471716,td_ungm_int,107393,ocds-0c46vo-0045-107393,["tender"],en,Futurist- COVID-19 Futures Support Team,"Background 
 Over the past year, the Data, Strategy and Innovation (DSI) Group has been working with Member States and countries to apply futures approaches to longer term health systems planning. Traditional planning generally strives to overcome problems and issues being faced at the time of planning and/or derived from experiences in the recent past. This retrospective approach can result in short-sighted responses that may not meet the challenges posed by a rapidly changing world with emerging environmental threats, political and demographic shifts and technological opportunities. By contrast, a strategic health futures dialogue is based on a prospective approach, by which a vision for the future is developed and policies and plans to achieve that vision are formed through backcasting.   
 This approach has been modified and coupled with an agile methodology to respond to the rapidly growing pandemic. Multidisciplinary teams tasked with looking at the future through a specific impact lens (e.g. NPIs, equity, economy) will be established: the teams will work over short sprints; describing future scenarios; and the impact on health systems and health status. Using a backcasting approach, the teams will then identify strategic actions for WHO and countries that future proof systems and responses, manage hyper change and build resilience. 
 Over the course of the pandemic, this approach will be applied and modified to give strategic advice to senior management within the WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific as well as shape guidance for countries.

 The COVID-19 pandemic has unleashed an unprecedented wave of creativity and collaboration. This wave of innovation – and the potential lessons being learned – risk being lost to history if there is no systematic approach or effort to capture what was done, and what is still being done. Despite the ever-increasing wealth of information regarding innovative products, services, approaches, and policies, evidence (and its translation into action) is still lacking given that many efforts are unprecedented, untested, iterative, and implemented in ways that prioritize practicality over scientific integrity. 
 Furthermore, many such innovations are inevitably context-dependent, at different levels of maturity, and pose challenges surrounding privacy and civil liberties. Research efforts must therefore be carefully crafted in order to produce the right kinds of knowledge asset for the right kind of stakeholder. The curation of such knowledge and its translation into relevant innovative solutions would better support Member States in identifying and adopting new options to address and inform strategic priorities.

The aim of the procurement is to try to gather services within SMS, communication services for employees and central internet reception that can be covered by one or several tenderers. Norsk Tipping currently has separate contracts, but would like to gather one or several of the contracts if appropriate. The communication services are necessary for ensuring that Norsk Tipping's employees have communication systems and tools to communicate with customers and provide gaming products.Subarea 1 SMS servicesNorsk Tipping expects, in line with the digital commitment and developments in recent years, that the amount of mobile communication will increase, at the same time as it becomes more nuanced and adapted to each customer to a greater and greater degree. Norsk Tipping is looking for to make its mobile communication with customers cost efficient, hence we are looking to move customer services from SMS to push notifications. The message services will still be expected to be free of charge for the company's customers, without there being any guarantee for this.Subarea 2 communication services for employeesElectronic forms of communication with the company's customers and employees play a central role in Norsk Tipping's digital commitment, this brings about the need for this procurement. The company's existing contract in this area with Telenor expires on 31 December 2020. It will be replaced by a new contract. It is important that tenderers have overall liability for the system.Subarea 3 push notificationsNorsk Tipping currently offers push notifications for ‘one-to many’ notifications such as prize drawing notifications, campaigns and scoring notifications. More personalised notifications are mainly sent by SMS and telephone. Norsk Tipping would like to move more of this over to push notifications and in general be able to offer more personalised push notifications. Norsk Tipping would like a system that handles the registration of mobile units for push notifications, as well as integration and dispatches to the different platform specific push services. The system must forward notifications from different services as push notifications to users of Norsk Tipping's applications. This will first be on Android and iOS and preferably also on the web.Subarea 4 central internet communication (SIK)Norsk Tipping intends to enter into a contract with a tenderer for the delivery of high performance internet communication and services for ensuring this. Norsk Tipping currently has high performance internet communication from both Telia and Telenor. The contract with Telenor will expire in the summer and a new contest must therefore be held. The communication is currently provided as Internet transit on fibre with close to 100 % running time. Norsk Tipping AS (AS202230) currently has a status as a LIR (Local Internet registry) and has separate official addresses for both IPv4 and IPv6. The need that must be met is the provision of internet transit communication with close to 100 % running time. In particular the capacity in the entire delivery chain is important. Security services are also important to guarantee running time and capacity.",,,2020-04-16 00:00:00.000000,,2020-05-14 00:00:00.000000,Norsk Tipping AS,Postboks 4414 Bedriftssenteret,Hamar,,2325,Norway,Trond Trondsgård Willard,Trond-Trondsgard.Willard@norsk-tipping.no,,,,http://ted.europa.eu/udl?uri=TED:NOTICE:178940-2020:TEXT:EN:HTML,"{64210000,64200000,64212000,64212100,64216000,72400000,72411000}",2020-04-16 09:32:54.553673,2020-04-16 09:32:54.553673,"{""uri"": ""https://openopps.com/tenders/ocds-0c46vo-0133-178940-2020/?format=json"", ""license"": ""https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/"", ""releases"": [{""id"": ""178940-2020"", ""tag"": [""tender""], ""date"": ""2020-04-16T00:00:00+00:00"", ""ocid"": ""ocds-0c46vo-0133-178940-2020"", ""buyer"": {""name"": ""Norsk Tipping AS"", ""address"": {""locality"": ""Hamar"", ""postalCode"": ""2325"", ""countryName"": ""Norway"", ""streetAddress"": ""Postboks 4414 Bedriftssenteret""}, ""contactPoint"": {""name"": ""Trond Trondsgård Willard"", ""email"": ""Trond-Trondsgard.Willard@norsk-tipping.no""}}, ""title"": ""Telephone and data transmission services"", ""tender"": {""id"": ""178940-2020_td"", ""items"": [{""id"": ""1"", ""classification"": {""id"": ""64210000"", ""scheme"": ""CPV""}, ""additionalClassifications"": [{""id"": ""64200000"", ""scheme"": ""CPV""}, {""id"": ""64212000"", ""scheme"": ""CPV""}, {""id"": ""64212100"", ""scheme"": ""CPV""}, {""id"": ""64216000"", ""scheme"": ""CPV""}, {""id"": ""72400000"", ""scheme"": ""CPV""}, {""id"": ""72411000"", ""scheme"": ""CPV""}]}], ""title"": ""SMS, Communication Services for Employees and Central Internet Communication"", ""documents"": [{""id"": ""tender_url"", ""url"": ""http://ted.europa.eu/udl?uri=TED:NOTICE:178940-2020:TEXT:EN:HTML"", ""format"": ""text/html"", ""language"": ""en"", ""documentType"": ""tenderNotice""}], ""description"": ""The aim of the procurement is to try to gather services within SMS, communication services for employees and central internet communication that can be covered by one or several tenderers.

This includes tender for new S-trains as well as upgrading the current infrastructure, safety system, passenger information systems, etc. to a full scale GoA4 operation. As part of the automation programme also a restructuring of the organisation around the Copenhagen S-bane will take place. The existing S-train fleet will reach its planned technical end-of-line in the years 2026-36. From 2028 and app. 10 years ahead new driverless S-trains must therefore be set in operation in parallel with the current conventional S-trains are being phased out of operation. Transforming the 85-year-old railway for a driverless system constitutes a highly complex and extensive conversion programme.
DSB tender out a non exclusive frame work agreement without a guaranteed minimum spend. The consultant shall assist DSB in delivering the below mentioned main components of the programme and in achieving a smooth S-train transition over the next app. 20 years provided both prolongation are exercised. The vision for the S-network is to deliver attractive mobility for customers to accommodate the population growth in the Danish capital region while securing financial and sustainable efficiency.Main components are:1) Tender, test and roll out of new automatic EMU fleet and automation. It is expected to tender out design, provision and technical integration of automated fleet and equipment and essential parts thereof and technology to support automated operation and essential parts of its maintenance. The expected technology to support automated operation in question will be e.g. passenger information system, train and platform monitoring and communication between passengers and the control room.2) Analysis, tender, test and roll out of obstacle detection system (ODS) and platform safety systems. It is expected to tender out relevant obstacle detection systems, including all platform components, SCADA systems and fencing at platforms and lineside allowing safe and punctual operations without train drivers in an automated train system in a brownfield network (172 km/84 stations/200 platforms.3) Tender and management of changes to and maintenance of the existing infrastructure. Procurement, management and implementation of new infrastructure elements and/or upgrades of the existing infrastructure. This includes signaling, passenger information, rail systems, depots, platform adjustments, stabling facilities, etc. and operational procedures allowing for a GoA4 operation and procurement of maintenance of new and existing infrastructure.4) Develop and manage a system design and necessary integration. This includes engineering of the entire S-train system and building of a solid operational and commercial concept and ensuring the impact is distributed correctly to the different parts of the engineering organisation.5) Building and implementation of a new organisation. This includes to plan, develop and manage the potential reorganising of the current set up on the public side by creating one public entity where today two parties exist (infrastructure manager/railway operator) including stakeholder and business change management.6) Plan and deliver a smooth transition.It is foreseen that the actual transition period will be up to 10 years where the S-train system will transfer from GoA2 mode (STO) to GoA4 mode (UTO). Managing the entire transition to ensure stable service offerings to travellers without performance drops throughout the transition phase will require thorough planning across all main components. See also Schedule 4 Programme and work description. All this requires consultancy services within a wide range of service areas. The service areas are described in Schedule 5 services and expertise. Please note that the final strategy and scope for the programme await political decision. Hence, the exact number of completed tenders and the timeframe for tenders covered by this contract has not been finally decided, but DSB expects that tenders of automated rolling stock and obstacle detective system are to commence immediately after contract signature. Please note that the current programme plan anticipates this contract to commence in December 2020.

This includes tender for new S-trains as well as upgrading the current infrastructure, safety system, passenger information systems, etc. to a full scale GoA4 operation. As part of the automation programme also a restructuring of the organisation around the Copenhagen S-bane will take place. The existing S-train fleet will reach its planned technical end-of-line in the years 2026-36. From 2028 and app. 10 years ahead new driverless S-trains must therefore be set in operation in parallel with the current conventional S-trains are being phased out of operation. Transforming the 85-year-old railway for a driverless system constitutes a highly complex and extensive conversion programme.\nDSB tender out a non exclusive frame work agreement without a guaranteed minimum spend. The consultant shall assist DSB in delivering the below mentioned main components of the programme and in achieving a smooth S-train transition over the next app. 20 years provided both prolongation are exercised. The vision for the S-network is to deliver attractive mobility for customers to accommodate the population growth in the Danish capital region while securing financial and sustainable efficiency.Main components are:1) Tender, test and roll out of new automatic EMU fleet and automation. It is expected to tender out design, provision and technical integration of automated fleet and equipment and essential parts thereof and technology to support automated operation and essential parts of its maintenance. The expected technology to support automated operation in question will be e.g. passenger information system, train and platform monitoring and communication between passengers and the control room.2) Analysis, tender, test and roll out of obstacle detection system (ODS) and platform safety systems. It is expected to tender out relevant obstacle detection systems, including all platform components, SCADA systems and fencing at platforms and lineside allowing safe and punctual operations without train drivers in an automated train system in a brownfield network (172 km/84 stations/200 platforms.3) Tender and management of changes to and maintenance of the existing infrastructure. Procurement, management and implementation of new infrastructure elements and/or upgrades of the existing infrastructure. This includes signaling, passenger information, rail systems, depots, platform adjustments, stabling facilities, etc. and operational procedures allowing for a GoA4 operation and procurement of maintenance of new and existing infrastructure.4) Develop and manage a system design and necessary integration. This includes engineering of the entire S-train system and building of a solid operational and commercial concept and ensuring the impact is distributed correctly to the different parts of the engineering organisation.5) Building and implementation of a new organisation. This includes to plan, develop and manage the potential reorganising of the current set up on the public side by creating one public entity where today two parties exist (infrastructure manager/railway operator) including stakeholder and business change management.6) Plan and deliver a smooth transition.It is foreseen that the actual transition period will be up to 10 years where the S-train system will transfer from GoA2 mode (STO) to GoA4 mode (UTO). Managing the entire transition to ensure stable service offerings to travellers without performance drops throughout the transition phase will require thorough planning across all main components. See also Schedule 4 Programme and work description. All this requires consultancy services within a wide range of service areas. The service areas are described in Schedule 5 services and expertise. Please note that the final strategy and scope for the programme await political decision. Hence, the exact number of completed tenders and the timeframe for tenders covered by this contract has not been finally decided, but DSB expects that tenders of automated rolling stock and obstacle detective system are to commence immediately after contract signature. Please note that the current programme plan anticipates this contract to commence in December 2020. However a number of currently ongoing activities are being affected by the COVID-19 situation and other activities are at risk. Seen together this situation might result in a later commencement of this contract and push the start date from December 2020 to Q1 2021, cf.
