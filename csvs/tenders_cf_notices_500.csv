The way learners access education is changing and increasingly incorporates learning from third-party websites and systems, not just those provided to them via HEE&#039;s own platforms and systems. However, finding the best and most appropriate resources can be difficult.

HEE is committed to the building of a digital ready workforce that can use technology effectively to support individuals and patients with their health and care in the present and as new technologies emerge in the future. To benchmark and develop these digital capabilities, it is necessary to assess the current levels of digital literacy in the health and care workforce.

The objective of this project is to develop and pilot a tool that will allow users to diagnose capability gaps according to HEE&#039;s digital capabilities framework, making recommendations of learning resources based on the gaps, and then enable participants to re-assess their abilities based on what they have learned, using artificial intelligence to tag and identify resources.

The way learners access education is changing and increasingly incorporates learning from third-party websites and systems, not just those provided to them via HEE&#039;s own platforms and systems. Many of those systems contain poorly structured data that needs indexing, enriching and aggregating so that it can be searchable through HEE&#039;s websites.

The TEL programme is in the process of developing a new learning product for everyone working in health and care in the UK. The Learning Hub will be a powerful new digital platform that will provide easy access to a wide range of education and training resources for the health and care workforce.

The Learning Hub will be the place to go to access and record learning from a broad range of shareable resources, including existing e-Learning for Healthcare (e-LfH) programmes, and resources contributed and uploaded from the user community. The Learning Hub will also encourage discussions to take place around the uploaded learning content and networks to form around areas of shared interest to maximise the opportunities for collaboration and realise the potential of the resources.

HEE have invested in the implementation and development of a taxonomy management system (Pool Party) and have developed a range of taxonomies and knowledge graphs.

This requirement is for Ion Chromatography System that is capable of analysing the ion contents of ionic liquids (eg anion purity, halide impurities), anion or cation counterions in surfactants (eg sodium, lithium, potassium dodecylsulfates, metal ion impurities eg Ca) and potentially analysis of carbohydrates and amino acids, full details of which are contained in the UK SBS PR19096 Specification Document.

This requirement for ISIS pulsed neutron and muon source which is a world-leading centre for research at the Science &amp; Technology Facilities Council (STFC), Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) near Oxford, in the UK. Our suite of neutron and muon instruments give unique insights into the properties of materials on the atomic scale.

The ISIS Deuteration Facility supports ISIS Users experiments by providing deuterated compounds for use within beamline experiments. The group is responsible for the synthesis of simple and more often large complex compounds. Part of this, we have a requirement to analyse the samples produced before handing over to the users. The type of samples that we produce range from simple perdeuterated fatty acids to complex surfactants where purity with respect to ion content is important. For certain systems the presence of other ions can have a major effect on the outcome of beamline experiments.

The NHS Long Term Plan outlined its intentions for the roll out of the NHS Personalised Care model across the country, reaching 2.5 million people by 2023/24 and then aiming to double that again within a decade. As part of this work, through social prescribing the range of support available to people will widen, diversify and become accessible across the country. Link workers within primary care networks will work with people to develop tailored plans and connect them to local groups and support services.

Our aim is to support our colleagues by providing access to a mindfulness app that provides us with business information on its use and engagement. By making mindfulness apps available to those that would benefit from using it most we aim to improve our workplace through increased productivity, improved focus, greater collaboration between colleagues, reduce absenteeism and improve people&#039;s personal resilience and wellbeing.

The main tunnel will run from Acton Storm Tanks in west London to Abbey Mills Pumping Station in the east, where it will connect to the Lee Tunnel, which will transfer the combined sewage to Beckton Sewage Treatment Works for treatment. The Project extends from Acton Storm Tanks in west London, to Abbey Mills Pumping Station in east London. The Project includes associated works at Beckton STW, Shad Thames Pumping Station and Bekesbourne Street. 
    
    The geographic layout of the Project and local authorities through which it passes is shown in Figure 1.
    The Project comprises:
    a. tunnels:
    i. a main tunnel which will capture and store combined sewage from CSOs along its route and transfer it to Abbey Mills Pumping Station, from where the Lee Tunnel will transfer it for treatment at Beckton Sewage Treatment Works
    ii. 11 connection tunnels, which will link flows from CSOs to the main tunnel.
    b. Worksites:
    i. five main tunnel Worksites (drive and/or reception sites)
    ii. 16 CSO Worksites
    iii. two System modification Worksites Thames Tideway Tunnel
    iv. works at Beckton Sewage Treatment works.
    
    Scope of Works
    
    The Hammersmith Pumping Station (HAMPS) Inlet Channel forms part of a live sewage pumping station infrastructure. It will remain operational throughout the duration of the project. This is a gravity-fed storm relief pumping station, with no physical or mechanical means of isolating the two sewers entering the Inlet Channel wet weather, thus all works are weather-dependent. 
    
    In order to ensure safety of the working teams, BMB have implemented a series of real-time catchment sewer monitoring along with computer modelling and weather forecast modelling tools which form part of the safe system of works (more details can be provided on request). Within the Inlet Channel, two temporary weir walls were installed, which are interconnected with a series of flumes to divert the flows through the works area (referred to as dry zone), effectively creating a cofferdam within the sewer environment 
    
    BMB JV are required to construct 4no elements of additional benching structures within the HAMPS Inlet Channel (highlighted in Figure 2), as follows:
    
    1.	Benching constructed on top of the base slab - 8m log, 2m wide (at base) with the outer face sloping towards the north wall at 45o, 750mm high. The subcontractor is to design, supply and install the formwork for this element. B16 dowels and face tension reinforcement bars (at 150mm c/c) will be supplied by BMB but will need cutting / bending and fixing by the subcontractor - no reinforcement drg is available at this stage but it is envisaged to have less than 100mm B16 bars.

    4.	Bullnose&#039; mass benching installed on top of the existing slab, against the wall section between the two sewer portals. This section will be curved in multiple directions - BMB will provide the formwork design and polystyrene Cordeck infill panels made to required shape - (combination of RDM / Cordeck formwork) - the Subcontractor to provide the remainder materials for the formwork and assemble it.
    Please note that entry upstream of the upstream temporary weir wall (items 2 and 3) is only possible during the safe tide window (+/- 2hrs from the low tide at Hammersmith) - a spreadsheet with exact tides for May and July was attached for reference. As north wall benching (item 1) is not restricted to low tide working, the Subcontractor&#039;s programme should allow for overlapping the activities such the low tide window is used for the upstream works and the remainder of the shift can be used for constructing Item 1 benching as well as all enabling works.

The main tunnel will run from Acton Storm Tanks in west London to Abbey Mills Pumping Station in the east, where it will connect to the Lee Tunnel, which will transfer the combined sewage to Beckton Sewage Treatment Works for treatment. The Project extends from Acton Storm Tanks in west London, to Abbey Mills Pumping Station in east London. The Project includes associated works at Beckton STW, Shad Thames Pumping Station and Bekesbourne Street. \r\n    \r\n    The geographic layout of the Project and local authorities through which it passes is shown in Figure 1.\r\n    The Project comprises:\r\n    a. tunnels:\r\n    i. a main tunnel which will capture and store combined sewage from CSOs along its route and transfer it to Abbey Mills Pumping Station, from where the Lee Tunnel will transfer it for treatment at Beckton Sewage Treatment Works\r\n    ii. 11 connection tunnels, which will link flows from CSOs to the main tunnel.\r\n    b.

Brief Description of Requirement

This study is focussed on the Pharmaceuticals sector, and there are two other sector studies - on fintech and fashion - being commissioned separately. The three sector studies are intended to be based upon deep experience and insight of the specific sector being examined.   The three sector studies, and a separate quantitative study on sizing the overall opportunity in the deep dive being commissioned separately, will all inform next steps.  Work in this stage takes account of the SQW technical note, which suggested the likely scale and wide range needed in a deep dive, and hence the need to consider carefully scope and methodology. 

Please ensure you review all attached information to ensure a full understanding of this requirement. All attachments can be found with the Document Uploads tab within the Delta eSourcing Portal.

This contract will be awarded based on the evaluation criteria set out in the ITQ  document.

The Strategic Transport team is customer focused and committed to delivering an excellent service to its residents in the provision of public transport information across the borough.

Lymington High Street currently has a cross street display of LED icicles and bulbs that currently takes it power from the top of 25 lighting columns throughout Queen St, St. Thomas Street and High Street which are evenly spaced throughout, thereby creating a flowing effect through the town &amp; down the hill. The Town Council is keen to carry on with this cross street lighting display for 2020 and subsequent years. The advice given by SSE is that in order to install the same display and utilise the bulb and icicle lighting purchased by the Town Council, there is a need for feeder pillars to be installed at suitable locations on the High Street, taking an unmetered supply from the Low Voltage network.

Lymington High Street currently has a cross street display of LED icicles and bulbs that currently takes it power from the top of 25 lighting columns throughout Queen St, St. Thomas Street and High Street which are evenly spaced throughout, thereby creating a flowing effect through the town &amp; down the hill. The Town Council is keen to carry on with this cross street lighting display for 2020 and subsequent years. The advice given by SSE is that in order to install the same display and utilise the bulb and icicle lighting purchased by the Town Council, there is a need for feeder pillars to be installed at suitable locations on the High Street, taking an unmetered supply from the Low Voltage network.

Progress Housing Group (PHG) are seeking an experienced Contractor to complete a refurbishment on one of their existing properties. This property is currently occupied by tenants with various learning difficulties. The property is no longer suitable to meet tenant&#039;s needs. PHG intend to source a compliant Contractor to take on the adaptation and refurbishment works to this existing domestic property. The Contractor will need to be fully compliant with all Health and Safety regulations and any other industry requirements. In summary, the works include the following;

&bull;Modification and conversion of garage to form additional en-suite wet rooms, including adapting the roof structure.
&bull;Internal alterations and refurbishment works within the existing property to form additional en-suite wet rooms. 
&bull;Associated plumbing and M&amp;E services alterations.
&bull;Associated decoration and new floor finishes throughout the property.

Due to this work being carried out the living tenants will be relocated into temporary accommodation, this will be at an additional cost to the organisation and it is therefore important that the programme is delivered on time and as per the specification programme. 
The property is located in Glendarroch, Craigs Road, Dumfries, Scotland and will be covered by Scottish Building regulations and Scottish Building Contract. It is beneficial that all bidders have some knowledge and experience, however there is an Employers Agent on this project who will assist in this process.

DO NOT apply directly to the buyer.

All tender information MUST be submitted through the Delta eSourcing Portal.

The Doctoral Training Partnership (DTP) scheme is AHRC&#039;s main mechanism for supporting doctoral students.  It is a commitment of &pound;164 million, over 11 awards, running from October 2014 to September 2022, by which time we will have supported more than 2,500 students.  It is important that AHRC reviews and evaluates the effectiveness of the scheme.  The supplier will undertake a robust, evidence-based review of the scheme which will enable AHRC to determine its future support for doctoral students.

The aim of the evaluation is to gain a better understanding of AHRC support for doctoral students through the DTP mechanism and whether the model itself is robust.

The main objective is to review the scheme against the original aims and principles for the scheme.

Tableau Server currently has on average over 1000+ unique users a month and approximately 35,000 views.

After substantial work in our Children&#039;s and Adults Departments, development of Tableau reporting is now required in our Environment and Transport Department, specifically in the Highways Control Service who are responsible for maintenance of the highways network throughout Leicestershire.

The BI Development Team, a small team of Tableau and Business Intelligence Developers, requires support in building a series of new operational Tableau dashboards using data from our Highways SQL Server database (Confirm) to a varied user base with different requirements.

The supplier is required to work closely with our internal BI team and with the Highways Department. This will include detailed requirements gathering, co-design of dashboards and presenting back findings.  It will require a significant number of days spent on our premises, therefor this opportunity is not suitable to be conducted remotely.

Please note: Leicestershire County Council already has an existing contract for Tableau, the scope of this opportunity is to provide consultancy to provide a suite of Highways dashboards with our established software. Therefore, we are unable to accommodate bids based on the use of other software solutions.

Please Note: Our tendering portal will be unavailable all day on Saturday January 25th, 2020 this has been accounted for in the procurement timeline. If you intend to submit a bid we recommend you download all documents from the portal, in order to ensure you are not hampered by this scheduled downtime.

It will require a significant number of days spent on our premises, therefor this opportunity is not suitable to be conducted remotely.\r\n\r\nPlease note: Leicestershire County Council already has an existing contract for Tableau, the scope of this opportunity is to provide consultancy to provide a suite of Highways dashboards with our established software. Therefore, we are unable to accommodate bids based on the use of other software solutions.\r\n\r\nPlease Note: Our tendering portal will be unavailable all day on Saturday January 25th, 2020 this has been accounted for in the procurement timeline. If you intend to submit a bid we recommend you download all documents from the portal, in order to ensure you are not hampered by this scheduled downtime.\r\n"", ""supplyChain"": false, ""hasEnquiries"": null, ""tenderPeriod"": {""endDate"": ""2020-02-03T00:00:00Z"", ""startDate"": ""2020-01-20T00:00:00Z""}, ""awardCriteria"": null, ""submissionMethod"": null, ""xClassifications"": {""isSuitableForSme"": true, ""isSuitableForVco"": false, ""ojeuContractType"": ""Services""}, ""procurementMethod"": null, ""eligibilityCriteria"": null, ""awardCriteriaDetails"": null, ""submissionMethodDetails"": ""Please apply directly to the buyer using the contact details provided, or follow the instructions given in the notice description or information section."", ""procurementMethodDetails"": ""Open procedure"", ""procurementMethodRationale"": """"}, ""language"": ""en-GB"", ""initiationType"": ""tender""}], ""publisher"": {""uid"": ""https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/04962733"", ""uri"": ""https://openopps.com"", ""name"": ""Open Opps"", ""scheme"": ""Companies House""}, ""publishedDate"": ""2020-05-08T02:11:57.502749+00:00""}",2020-01-20 09:35:00.000000

On 24 July 2019, NICE published Technology appraisal guidance on the use of the drug Nusinersen to treat patients with 5q Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA). This is a rare, genetic, neuromuscular disease, characterised by spinal motor neuron loss, muscle atrophy and motor impairment. SMA is debilitating for all patients and fatal for the worst affected; patients and their families can experience extremely high levels of burden.

NHS England has agreed a &#039;Managed Access Agreement (MAA)&#039; for the drug nusinersen for the treatment of eligible patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). The NICE guidance sets out that the drug should only be made available to people who meet the criteria for treatment under the associated MAA.

The key objectives of the Compliance Process are: to commission the service(s) to serve adult patients eligible to receive the treatment nationally. It is estimated that 600 patients (adults and children) will be treated in England over the lifetime of the contract. Patients&#039; eligibility and population covered are described in section 4 of the Managed Access Agreement. This may include treating patients from the devolved nations.

The Commissioner is seeking to appoint providers who have expertise in the treatment of adults with SMA (from 16-18 years of age, depending on local agreements) and who have the infrastructure both to be able to treat patients with nusinersen (which is given by intrathecal injection) and to collect detailed monitoring information about eligible patients. Providers will need to demonstrate that they are suitably qualified and can meet the agreed service requirements.

In 2019, NHS England ran a compliance process to appoint providers to deliver the service and was able to appoint several suitably qualified and experienced providers. Since then, the Commissioners have assessed patients&#039; needs and have identified service gaps nationally. In order to address these gaps, the Commissioners are re-issuing the opportunity.

Further information about scope and qualification requirements can be found in the process documentation published on the EU Supply eTender/Procurement portal (Quote/tender 39295).

The exhibition opens to the public on 8th May but is required to be completed by 4th May 2020 to allow for press, PR and a private view to take place. The exhibition runs for 1 year.

As part of the exhibition build the main build contractors are creating a profile of a Chieftain tank in MDF, CNC routed as per drawings A22, A23. 

NAM would like to appoint a creative audio-visual company to create and deliver a sequence of film and animation that will be projected onto the tank.

&bull;	Excerpts from the Lionheart 84 film from the IWM which shows the biggest mobilisation of troops to test and demonstrate the ability of NATO forces to withstand an attack from Russia. 
&bull;	Film of Chieftain manoeuvres from the Allied Museum.
&bull;	Production and Projection of the statistics outlined in Appendix E.

All the above should be merged into a seamless film projection that will be motion triggered when visitors walk in the proximity of the tank profile.

When the film is not triggered, we would like to create a rendering of the Chieftain tank to be projected onto the tank profile. We would provide an accurate line drawing to use. The rendering of the tank would act as a &#039;screen saver&#039; and would animate occasionally by the wheels rolling.

The Foe to Friend exhibition also has another large projection at the beginning of the exhibition as outlined in drawings AV Designs Briefs Appendix E.  NAM would also like the creative audio-visual tenderers to quote for editing this film of Operation Varsity, troops crossing the Rhine after WWII, sub-titling and ensuring the sound recording blends well. Please separate this out from the tank costs as outlined in the pricing document, Appendix  F.  Your pricing should account for the creation and delivery of both the tank projection and the Operation Varsity exhibits to site at NAM.

The purpose of this market engagement is to assess the level of interest from suitably qualified providers to deliver the service, and to consult with the market on potential service developments following a pilot period.
The service will enable recovery and rehabilitation for individuals with complex mental health needs, and must include:  

&bull;	A full MDT;
&bull;	A robust model based on clinically appropriate therapeutic interventions, and recognised outcomes tools;
&bull;	Family/carer support;
&bull;	Access to statutory and non-statutory advocacy; and 
&bull;	Ability to support complex presentations including co-morbidities (which may involve physical health issues and other psychiatric diagnoses such as personality disorder and wider issues such as substance misuse, self-harm and forensic histories).
The service will be commissioned using a block contract with an indicative annual contract value of &pound;1,680,000 to &pound;1,747,200 per annum with the contract term being a year with a possible option to extend by a further year under an all-inclusive pricing block contract.
A service specification is being developed to reflect the current requirements of the CCG. The CCG would like potential providers to complete the Market Engagement Questionnaire (MEQ) which provides additional details about the proposed service and will be used to assess the level of interest and review the service specification for any potential service developments. 
Any MEQ responses will not be treated as commercially confidential and may be used by the CCG in the final service specification used for the contract but no organisation will be individually identified. This early engagement process will be used to help shape the final version of the specification and to determine the most appropriate route to contract award.
It is likely that this potential contracting opportunity will be subject to a competitive procurement process to enable the CCG to identify the most suitable and qualified provider to deliver the service. A lack of interest being expressed in response to this invitation may be taken as evidence by the CCG that a competitive process may not be required. CONFIRMATION OF YOUR EXPRESSION OF INTEREST IS THEREFORE IMPORTANT.
This advert has been advertised on both Contract Finder and OJEU.
Potential providers wishing to express an interest and submit a completed MEQ located in the document section of EU-Supply by no later than 4pm on 4th March 2020, should register on EU Supply using link https://uk.eu-supply.com and search for Tender Reference 39089 .

Associated works could include fencing, drainage, the construction of steps and ramps and the installation of street furniture. Sites will be released to the Contractor on Works Orders and could range from a single Order for a patch repair (minimum value &pound;500) to an order for a new car park or multiple sites across the city (maximum value &pound;150,000). No continuity of work can be guaranteed and the Contractor will be expected to mobilise within 4 weeks of receiving an Order. The Contract Period will initially be for 12 months up to 25th June 2021 with a provision to extend a further 36 months subject to annual review. The reviews will take place in March and the respective 12 months extension will be dependent on budget availability and continuing good performance by the Contractor. Contractor performance will be measured using the KPI&#039;s outlined in Appendix H (see Preliminaries Item 1.8.6.8).

These regulations place responsibility on the authority for maintaining an adequate and effective internal audit service.

The LPFA Audit and Risk Committee is responsible to the LPFA Board for ensuring that there is an adequate system of internal control, and that it is maintained and complied with on a routine basis. The lead officer responsible for maintaining the system of internal control is the Managing Director of LPFA, although the LPFA acknowledges that internal controls are a collective responsibility with the LPFA Audit &amp; Risk Committee and the Section 151 Officer also has responsibility in this area.

The LPFA will prepare an Annual Governance Statement to review the effectiveness of the system of internal control, and this is signed by the LPFA Managing Director and the Chair of the LPFA Audit &amp; Risk Committee. This is supported by a statement from the Head of the Internal Audit function on the effectiveness of the system of internal control.

The LPFA Audit &amp; Risk Committee has the responsibility for reviewing the effectiveness of the internal audit function. The Committee will receive regular reports from the internal audit provider, and the senior internal auditor will attend the Audit &amp; Risk Committee meetings.
The Head of Internal Audit, to be provided by the supplier, will be required to work with other elements of the audit services. This includes the LPFA&#039;s external auditors (currently Grant Thornton) but may also require working with the internal and external audit service of Local Pensions Partnerships, (currently Deloitte internal and Grant Thornton external).

LPFA may also make use of external consultants to support organisational development. The internal audit function may identify areas for external consultancy to advise on, and support implementation of, new systems following recommendations from external consultants.

The Contract term will be 12 months (1st April 2020 to 31st March 2021), with the option to extend the contract for 12 months (1st April 2021 to 31st March 2022) at the sole discretion of the Commissioners.
NHS Castle Point and Rochford Clinical Commissioning Group on behalf of MSE STP secured funding to enable circa 50 priority GP Practices sites to fully digitalise their LG wallets. This procurement relates to Phase 1 of the programme requiring the provision of the service for an estimated 578,632 LG wallets across circa 50 GP Practices, by no later than 31st March 2021.
If funding becomes available there may be the potential to roll out the digitisation of LG wallets to other GP Practices within the MSE STP footprint, however at this stage, funding has only been secured for Phase 1 (circa 50 prioritised Primary Care sites, see Specification for further detail).
The estimated potential aggregate contract value over the contract term (1 year + 1 year extension) is &pound;4,338,246 GBP.

The aim of this service is to build people&#039;s capacity to thrive, and to create greater resilience to help them deal with issues encountered throughout their private and professional lives.

The Council has been running a successful Mindfulness programme for staff members over the past 5 years.  The new service will include a re-focus on using mindfulness for capacity building to enable people to thrive in all areas of their life.

Dorset Council is seeking tenders from suitably experienced and capable service providers for a Family Group Conference (FGC) Service.
A Family Group Conference (FGC) is a decision making and planning process facilitated independently, where the wider family and friend&#039;s network agree and make plans and decisions for children and young people who 
&bull;	have been identified as being at risk
&bull;	and are in need of a plan that will safeguard and promote their welfare
&bull;	and which will address the problems identified by professionals who know the child.

Family Group Conferences are arranged and co-ordinated by a Service Provider following an appropriate referral. They can be held for a variety of reasons related to the welfare of the child or young person. An FGC can involve all family members, friends and other adults who the family feel can contribute to making plans for the children. The decision makers at family group conferences are the family members and not the professionals. Professionals though, can also be included in the process as appropriate and with the agreement of the family.

Dorset Council has commissioned the use of Family Group Conferences since late 2015 initially as a short-term pilot scheme and then through a longer formal contract.  Demand for the service has grown quickly. It is anticipated to increase further as the benefits of FGCs become more widely known. 

The Service Provider shall:
&bull;	Organise all Family Group Conferences and FGC Review Meeting arrangements,
&bull;	Ensure participation of parents/carers and families,
&bull;	Build and maintain relationships with other services
&bull;	and meet all the requirements of the service specification attached to this tender.

The Service Specification also details the service aims and objectives, description of the service and eligibility, staffing requirements, referral process, performance management and reporting.

This tender relates to provisions for children, young people, adults and their families.

The contract will commence from 1st August 2020 and will run for a period of 1 year with the possibility of 2 further 12-month extension periods.",0,GBP,2020-02-28 11:52:22.000000,2020-02-28 11:52:22.000000,2020-03-30 00:00:00.000000,Dorset Council,"Dorset Council South Walks House, South Walks Road",Dorchester,,DT1 1UZ,England,Charlotte Chesters,charlotte.chesters@dorsetcouncil.gov.uk,+44 1305221649,,,https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/Notice/a2468a49-58b1-4eb9-9a19-5749efe3cb28,{85320000},2020-02-29 01:33:03.432544,2020-05-08 02:11:42.011553,"{""uri"": ""https://openopps.com/tenders/ocds-0c46vo-0001-a2468a49-58b1-4eb9-9a19-5749efe3cb28/?format=json"", ""releases"": [{""id"": ""ocds-b5fd17-72d84d6d-8eca-4cac-be94-dc500027fe61-346747-dorst001-dn467453-68591790"", ""tag"": [""tender""], ""date"": ""2020-02-28T11:52:22Z"", ""ocid"": ""ocds-0c46vo-0001-a2468a49-58b1-4eb9-9a19-5749efe3cb28"", ""buyer"": {""name"": ""Dorset Council"", ""address"": {""region"": null, ""locality"": ""Dorchester"", ""postalCode"": ""DT1 1UZ"", ""countryName"": ""England"", ""streetAddress"": ""Dorset Council South Walks House, South Walks Road""}, ""contactPoint"": {""uri"": ""https://www.dorsetcouncil.gov.uk"", ""name"": ""Charlotte Chesters"", ""email"": ""charlotte.chesters@dorsetcouncil.gov.uk"", ""faxNumber"": null, ""telephone"": ""+44 1305221649""}}, ""tender"": {""id"": ""ocds-b5fd17-72d84d6d-8eca-4cac-be94-dc500027fe61-dorst001-dn467453-68591790"", ""items"": [{""id"": 1, ""description"": ""See description of related tender."", ""classification"": {""id"": ""85320000"", ""uri"": ""http://cpv.data.ac.uk/code-85320000.html"", ""scheme"": ""CPV"", ""description"": ""Social services""}}], ""title"": ""Provision of Family Group Conferences 2020"", ""value"": {""amount"": 0, ""currency"": ""GBP""}, ""status"": ""active"", ""minValue"": {""amount"": 320259, ""currency"": ""GBP""}, ""documents"": [{""id"": ""tender_url"", ""url"": ""https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/Notice/a2468a49-58b1-4eb9-9a19-5749efe3cb28"", ""format"": ""text/html"", ""language"": ""en"", ""documentType"": ""tenderNotice""}], ""milestones"": [{""id"": 1, ""title"": ""Contract start"", ""status"": null, ""dueDate"": ""2020-08-01T00:00:00Z"", ""description"": ""Anticipated contract start date""}, {""id"": 2, ""title"": ""Contract end"", ""status"": null, ""dueDate"": ""2021-07-31T00:00:00Z"", ""description"": ""Anticipated contract end date""}], ""description"": ""Provision of Family Group Conferences 2020 - Open Tender Procedure\r\n\r\nDorset Council is seeking tenders from suitably experienced and capable service providers for a Family Group Conference (FGC) Service.\r\nA Family Group Conference (FGC) is a decision making and planning process facilitated independently, where the wider family and friend&#039;s network agree and make plans and decisions for children and young people who \r\n&bull;\thave been identified as being at risk\r\n&bull;\tand are in need of a plan that will safeguard and promote their welfare\r\n&bull;\tand which will address the problems identified by professionals who know the child.\r\n\r\nFamily Group Conferences are arranged and co-ordinated by a Service Provider following an appropriate referral.

We are keen to secure services to support wheelchair accessibility.
The Council&#039;s Passenger Transport Services Framework will provide transport services to children, young people and adults, both with and without additional needs.
Clients could have a range of needs including; being wheelchair users and individuals with mobility needs, learning needs, sensory impairment, hidden disabilities, or a combination of these. In some cases, a passenger assistant will be required.
The type of vehicle that can be used is flexible as long as it meets the required specification.
We want to engage with suppliers who will:
- Work closely with us and understand our needs.
- Demonstrate flexibility and react quickly to changing service demands to support changes to the Council&#039;s requirements and our residents.
- Be innovative and efficient in the delivery of passenger transport services.
- Conduct their business in a socially responsible and ethical way.                                                                                         
Currently approximately 900 children, young people and adults over the age of 18 attend over 100 different venues, with 37 of these situated within the Borough and 63 are situated out of the Borough. The majority of these passengers (~75%) attend venues in the Borough. Educational establishments operate throughout the academic year from September to July with half term and term breaks. Arrival times vary from 8AM to 9AM and departure times vary from 2:30PM to 4PM. Further to this, approximately 210 adult clients attend 12 day activity venues. These services are required throughout the calendar year (closed bank holidays) and operate between 7:45AM to 10:30AM in the morning, and 2:45PM to 5:30PM in the afternoon.                                                      
The Council is reopening this opportunity for a limited period in conformity with 76 (4) of the Public Contracts Regulation 2015 due to feedback received from a number of tenderers regarding technical issues with receiving notifications about this opportunity.

Through a consortium of IPPF Member Associations (MAs) and five internationally recognized organizations and led by IPPF, WISH2ACTION prioritizes the most underserved women and girls, particularly youth under 20, the very poor, and other marginalized populations (including people with disability, people displaced or affected by humanitarian crisis, and people living in hard-to-reach areas). Areas of integrated service delivery supported through WISH2ACTION include comprehensive family planning services, safe abortion and post abortion care, STI and HIV testing and treatment, counselling, SGBV services, and cervical cancer screening. The exact package of care, range of services, and nature of integration between services differs by country and by service delivery channel depending on factors including the legal context, government policy and provider capacity etc.

IPPF seeks a contractor to take responsibility for the Communications Strategy of this multi-country, integrated Family Planning and Reproductive Health programme. This position will serve to raise awareness about the WISH2ACTION programme goals, objectives and benefits among key public and private stakeholder groups, emphasizing communications support, comprehensive media outreach and publicity; and supporting project partners to share information on core project components.

The Council is keen to obtain a breadth of representation of different identity aspects to include but not limited to, Older adult, Working Adult, Unemployed Adult, Teenager, White British, White non-British, African-Caribbean, South Asian, Chinese, LGBT person, Disability, Muslim, Sikh, Christian faiths. The ethnographic research will be entwined with local and national evidence to highlight the gaps, need for services and successes from the perspective of those men and women.  The purpose of this report is to identify areas of need to better support recovery and minimise inequality experienced in the City as a result of Covid-19.
      
      The successful provider will be required to undertake and deliver:
      o 6-8 ethnographic studies of Birmingham residents identifying as one or more of the following: 
      Older adult, Working Adult, Unemployed Adult, Teenager, White British, White non-British, African-Caribbean, South Asian, Chinese, LGBT person, Disability, Muslim, Sikh, Christian faiths. N.B. one individual may identify with more than one of these groups, however we would like each of these areas to be covered within the 6-8 ethnographic study participants.  
      The ethnography will illustrate:
      o The prolonged impacts of Covid-19 for example the impact of social distancing, direct and indirect experiences of illness, treatment, death, grief and bereavement; service delivery (if in key worker or other front-line role); mental health and wellbeing 
      o How their Covid-19 journey has impacted on other aspects of their lives, and along their journey what experiences and support needs they have had
      o Where the system failed the individual and how this could have been prevented
      o What services were available to them at the time vs. what services they needed
      o How they currently view life in Birmingham
      o What support needs they perceive for themselves as individuals, their communities and the City as a whole from their perspective
      The Contract will run for a period of up to 6 months.

The specification documents lay out some of the more general detail relevant to the necessary work to be carried out. Prospective providers will be required to accept the General Conditions and Form of Contract. 

The Saint Piran is a fisheries patrol vessel owned and managed by Cornwall Inshore Fisheries and Conservation Authority (Cornwall IFCA) and is berthed in Newlyn, Cornwall . She is 27.17m overall length, has a beam of 6.75m and a draft of 1.75m. She was built in 2000 and is constructed from aluminium and her gross tonnage is 117.26 tonnes. 

She is subject to biennial refits, of which this contract is a minor refit and repaint. Due to the ongoing operational requirements for the vessel, contractors are invited to tender to deliver this refit during mid March through to late April but this is contingent on having suitable weather to complete the hull coating. As a result, contractors are invited to provide an additional optional price to allow for placing the vessel undercover to enable this work to be completed to avoid any weather constraints.

The vessel will be accompanied by the skipper and permanent engineering crew who will act as the owner&#039;s representatives onsite.

All interested contractors are encouraged to visit the vessel in Newlyn, Cornwall and contact should be made in the first instance through the contact details provided as follows for Cornwall IFCA:

The successful provider will be required to permit full access to the vessel during normal working hours to our surveyor, engineers and subcontractors (if any).

As a result, contractors are invited to provide an additional optional price to allow for placing the vessel undercover to enable this work to be completed to avoid any weather constraints.\r\n\r\nThe vessel will be accompanied by the skipper and permanent engineering crew who will act as the owner&#039;s representatives onsite.\r\n\r\nAll interested contractors are encouraged to visit the vessel in Newlyn, Cornwall and contact should be made in the first instance through the contact details provided as follows for Cornwall IFCA:\r\n\r\nSamantha Davis\r\nChief Officer\r\nCornwall Inshore Fisheries &amp; Conservation Authority\r\nChi Gallos\r\nHayle Marine Renewables Business Park\r\nNorth Quay\r\nHayle\r\nCornwall TR27 4DD\r\nEmail: samantha.davis@cornwall-ifca.gov.uk or telephone 01736 336842  \r\nAll other contact, e.g. any tender queries and access to tender documentation etc. should ONLY be made via the messaging system on the Proactis Portal and the Portal opportunity can be accessed via the supplyingthesouthwest.org.uk website where the project has the reference DN449468. \r\nThe successful provider will be required to permit full access to the vessel during normal working hours to our surveyor, engineers and subcontractors (if any). \r\nThe successful provider will be notified as soon as possible after the closing date, but will need to provide satisfactory evidence of its insurance cover, prior to the contract being agreed.

Its aim is to improve the places and spaces in Camelford, enabling people to come together and build strong relationships.  CTC want to enable people to fulfil their potential by offering employment and/or volunteering opportunities, take part in community events (thus creating a sense of belonging) and involve as many people in our projects so that they feel a sense of ownership. 

CTC is looking to regenerate the Old Cattle Market site in the Summer of 2020  from a derelict historical site, into a multi-use, inclusive recreational facility.  This facility will meet the needs of our local community, the villages and towns in the surrounding area and bring in visitors and tourists to help regenerate Camelford, a once thriving market town.  The project includes a multi-use court (basketball, netball, dodgeball, tennis and five-a-side football), parkour area, outside gym equipment, community gardens, caf&eacute;/youth hub, waterless toilet, and creation of an additional skate-able surface with lower boxes and rails to cater for younger children.
Extensive community engagement has formed this vision.  The facilities and activities it proposes to offer are those that have been identified by our community. A wish to make life that little bit better, more enjoyable and more conducive to a sociable life where people will spend time together in a place they enjoy, with activities that will provide people with the confidence and skills to achieve their ambitions.  Anti-social behaviour, low self-esteem, low aspiration are current issues in Camelford. This project seeks to show our community, especially our children/young people, that they are worth investing in, and provide a network of people who can guide, teach and inspire them.  CTC believes that the facilities and activities proposed are the most effective response to the issues that Camelford faces.  This regeneration will complement existing provision within our Town. It is realistic, sustainable and has full support of the community, the Town Council, local schools and businesses, local organisations and Cornwall Council.

The strategic approach to coastal flood and erosion risk management within the project area is guided by the South Devon and Dorset Shoreline management Plan (SMP2) policies defined in 2010 and are primarily &quot;Hold the Line&quot; along this frontage.

Registration with the Register of Apprentice Providers is a prerequisite, along with a track record of experience of delivering apprentice training in the Local Government Sector.
      
      Birmingham City Council will work with the awarded training provider and the apprentice to support and mentor apprentices as part of their long-term career pathway. In addition to this Managers will have regular communications with the training provider regarding feedback on performance/attendance of the apprentices, including any key milestones/achievements and satisfaction levels of the tutor/assessor; manager and apprentice.
      
      The Training Provider will:
      o be funded the agreed cost of the training for all apprentices with the city council&#039;s Apprenticeship Levy via the Digital Apprenticeship System, once a contract for service has been signed by both parties.
      o ensure that during the 20% off the job learning, apprentices do not breach any GDPR regulations that could implicate the council.
      o work with the city council to ensure that the pattern of training suits the needs of the service. This would be a separate day release for each apprentice. The Training Provider will provide details of the delivery location for classroom-based provision.
      o ensure that apprentices are provided with regular timetables, and attendance is regularly recorded and fed back to the manager, this includes regular contact with manager during &#039;day releases&#039;. The Training Provider should notify the apprentice&#039;s manager, should the apprentice fail to attend training, and work with the manager to organise an action plan to resolve any further absences. Persistent failure to meet the 20% off the job learning will result in disciplinary action against the apprentice and potential dismissal. The city council will notify the Training Provider if this is the case and will not impact on the cost of the training already funded.
